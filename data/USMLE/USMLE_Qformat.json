The patient's last visit to the office was 2 years ago, and today he says he is \"doing about the same,\" except for an unintentional 10-kg (22-lb) weight gain. He attributes the weight gain to inability to exercise because of his back pain, and he is now considering applying for disability benefits. He was evaluated by a back pain specialist 3 months ago and underwent an MRI of the lumbar spine at that time; however, he says he did not understand the specialist's explanation regarding the MRI results and requests further explanation. Medical history also is remarkable for hyperlipidemia, seasonal allergies, and opioid use disorder; he has not used opioids of any kind since he stopped prescription oxycodone use 5 years ago. Routine medications are atorvastatin, diclofenac, and loratadine. He develops skin flushing when taking niacin, but he has no known drug allergies. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 25 years. He previously drank two beers daily, but he has not consumed any alcoholic beverages or used any recreational drugs for the past 5 years. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits; blood pressure is 128/70 mm Hg. While standing, the patient leans forward slightly. Range of motion on lumbar extension and flexion is decreased. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities.

On arrival, he is obtunded. He is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Examination shows flaccid paralysis on the right. A CT scan of the head shows a large evolving cerebral infarction on the left. Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows dissection of the left carotid artery. After receiving intensive medical care for 6 hours, the patient develops decerebrate posturing and becomes hemodynamically unstable. Vasopressor therapy is begun. A second CT scan of the head shows a massive left hemispheric cerebral infarction with severe edema and herniation. The physician determines that surgical intervention is not indicated because of the patient's poor prognosis. The patient's driver's license indicates that he wishes to be an organ donor. The physician meets with the patient's family and informs them about the patient's prognosis, and they are devastated. During the meeting, they say that they were unaware of his willingness to be an organ donor and agree that he should not receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

He is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Examination shows flaccid paralysis on the right. A CT scan of the head shows a large evolving cerebral infarction on the left. Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows dissection of the left carotid artery. After receiving intensive medical care for 6 hours, the patient develops decerebrate posturing and becomes hemodynamically unstable. Vasopressor therapy is begun. A second CT scan of the head shows a massive left hemispheric cerebral infarction with severe edema and herniation. The physician determines that surgical intervention is not indicated because of the patient's poor prognosis. The patient's driver's license indicates that he wishes to be an organ donor. The physician meets with the patient's family and informs them about the patient's prognosis, and they are devastated. During the meeting, they say that they were unaware of his willingness to be an organ donor and agree that he should not receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between stress levels and fibromyalgia-related pain (P<.05). Similarly, statistically significant relationships were found between Type A personality participants and increased stress levels (P<.01), as well as increased levels of fibromyalgia-related pain (P<.005).

He was born at 37\u00c2\u00a0weeks' gestation via cesarean delivery because of chorioamnionitis. The infant had fetal distress that was documented by fetal monitoring during labor. The mother became jaundiced in the immediate postpartum period and was found to have hepatitis\u00c2\u00a0C (HCV) and HIV infection. She is unaware of her hepatitis\u00c2\u00a0B (HBV) status but knows that her son received the hepatitis\u00c2\u00a0B vaccination on the second day of life. The infant's weight today is 3912\u00c2\u00a0g (8\u00c2\u00a0lb\u00c2\u00a010\u00c2\u00a0oz); physical examination shows no abnormalities. The mother wants to know what chance her child has of having contracted HIV or HCV infection from her. The risk for vertical transmission of HIV is approximately 20%. The mother is advised and appropriate management is planned for the infant regarding HIV. To determine the risk of HCV transmission, a recently published study of risk factors for perinatal transmission of HCV in 155\u00c2\u00a0mothers coinfected with HIV and HCV is reviewed.

He was born at 37\u00c2\u00a0weeks' gestation via cesarean delivery because of chorioamnionitis. The infant had fetal distress that was documented by fetal monitoring during labor. The mother became jaundiced in the immediate postpartum period and was found to have hepatitis\u00c2\u00a0C (HCV) and HIV infection. She is unaware of her hepatitis\u00c2\u00a0B (HBV) status but knows that her son received the hepatitis\u00c2\u00a0B vaccination on the second day of life. The infant's weight today is 3912\u00c2\u00a0g (8\u00c2\u00a0lb\u00c2\u00a010\u00c2\u00a0oz); physical examination shows no abnormalities. The mother wants to know what chance her child has of having contracted HIV or HCV infection from her. The risk for vertical transmission of HIV is approximately 20%. The mother is advised and appropriate management is planned for the infant regarding HIV. To determine the risk of HCV transmission, a recently published study of risk factors for perinatal transmission of HCV in 155\u00c2\u00a0mothers coinfected with HIV and HCV is reviewed.
