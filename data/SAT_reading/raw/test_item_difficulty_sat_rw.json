    "Prompt": "The following text is from H.D.’s 1916 poem “Mid-Day.” In the poem, the speaker is on a path in an outdoor setting. A slight wind shakes the seed-pods — my thoughts are spent as the black seeds. My thoughts tear me, I dread their fever. I am scattered in its whirl. I am scattered like the hot shrivelled seeds.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",
    "A": "It illustrates a change in the natural environment that the speaker implies is responsible for the growing misgivings described in the text.",
    "B": "It establishes an example of consistency in the natural landscape that the speaker then contrasts with the unpredictability of human emotions.",
    "C": "It presents an observation of an occurrence in the natural world that the speaker then expands on to convey a sense of a turbulent interior state.",
    "D": "It evokes the ordinariness of an event in nature to suggest that the critical self-evaluation the speaker engages in is a common pursuit.",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. In the text, the speaker mentions the occurrence in nature of seedpods being shaken by a slight wind. The speaker then goes on to compare the black seeds to thoughts, using language that indicates that the speaker’s state of mind is unsettled (e.g., \"my thoughts are spent\"; \"My thoughts tear me, I dread their fever\"). The text concludes with a comparison between the speaker’s \"scattered\" state of mind and the \"hot shrivelled seeds.\" Thus, the underlined portion of the text presents an observation of an occurrence in the natural world that the speaker then expands on to convey a sense of a turbulent interior state.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate that the seedpods are the cause of the speaker’s state of mind; thus, they could not be responsible for any misgivings the speaker has. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not contrast the natural landscape with the speaker’s state of mind or describe the wind shaking the seedpods as consistent; rather, the text suggests that the state of the natural world and the speaker’s state of mind are similar in that both are unsettled. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that the speaker regularly engages in critical self-evaluation, only that in this particular instance the speaker’s state of mind is turbulent.",

But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be reversible. Text 2 In 2015, physicists Tiago Batalhão et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform.

    "text_prompt_table_figure_options_answer_rationale": "Text 1 The idea that time moves in only one direction is instinctively understood, yet it puzzles physicists. According to the second law of thermodynamics, at a macroscopic level some processes of heat transfer are irreversible due to the production of entropy—after a transfer we cannot rewind time and place molecules back exactly where they were before, just as we cannot unbreak dropped eggs. But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be reversible. Text 2 In 2015, physicists Tiago Batalhão et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform. But the experiment “does not pinpoint ... what causes [irreversibility] at the microscopic level,” coauthor Mauro Paternostro said.

It is consistent with the current understanding of physics at a microscopic level but not at a macroscopic level. It supports a claim about an isolated system of atoms in a laboratory, but that claim should not be extrapolated to a general claim about the universe. B Choice B is the best answer. Author 1 describes the puzzle that physicists still can’t solve: at a microscopic level, the “laws of physics” suggest that we should be able to reverse processes that are not reversible at a macroscopic level (and, maybe, turn back time!). The experiment confirmed that those processes are not reversible even on the microscopic level, but it didn’t explain why. This supports Author 1’s point that physicists still don’t fully understand how things work at a microscopic level—maybe the laws need to be revised.\nChoice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Text 2 does name two of the physicists involved in the experiment, but it never suggests that they disagree on anything. Choice C is incorrect. This is the opposite of what the experiment suggests. The experiment confirmed that the macroscopic-level law (“these things can’t be reversed—like time”) was still true on the microscopic level—meaning it supports the current understanding of physics at a macroscopic level. Choice D is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Neither text makes this distinction between laboratory findings and the way the universe works in general.",

The broths in the 2007 experiment most likely did not have a substantial amount of the dipeptides that played a key part in the 2022 experiment. D Choice D is the best answer. Ishii and O’Mahony were trying to isolate the pure umami flavor, while Jünger was trying to recreate soy sauce, which has a mix of flavors that includes umami. Accordingly, the broths from Text 1 are not described as having any soy sauce in them—just “shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed.” So they probably don’t have as much of the dipeptides described in Text 2, which were found to be a key part of soy sauce’s umami-ness and its saltiness.\nChoice A is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Neither text gets into the diets of people in the United States, nor the diets of people in Japan. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Text 2 does talk about the molecular weights of chemical compounds, but there isn’t enough information provided about molecular weights in Text 1 to make an inference about what the scientists in Text 1 would say. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Text 1 briefly mentions that soy sauce is “made from fermented soybeans,” but it never claims that fermentation is responsible for its flavor in any way. And Text 2 never mentions fermentation at all.",

    "Prompt": "Gorgets, or necklaces with large pendants, have been part of the ceremonial attire of tribes from the US Southeast for centuries. One of the oldest examples, the Fairfield Gorget, was found in Fairfield, Missouri, in 1958. Its overall design resembles that of other art from the region during the Mississippian period (900–1600 CE). Yet the image on the gorget is of a jaguar—a species whose range doesn’t extend to Missouri. Jaguar images are common in ancient Mexican art, and Mexico lies squarely in the species’ range. Therefore, some scholars argue that long-distance trade in Mexican art objects brought the imagery to Missouri, where a local artist could have adopted it and incorporated it into the Fairfield Gorget.",
    "Question Text": "Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation?",
    "A": "The Fairfield Gorget is dated not to the Mississippian period but instead to the earlier Woodland period, which ended around 900 CE.",
    "B": "The range of the jaguar is shown to have expanded dramatically after the Mississippian period came to a close around 1600 CE.",

    "D": "Certain works by present-day artists from Southeastern tribes reflect outside cultural influences, including contemporary Mexican art.",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation that the jaguar imagery on the Fairfield Gorget could have been inspired by art objects brought to Missouri from Mexico. The text describes the Fairfield Gorget as one of the oldest examples of these necklaces, noting that it’s similar to other art from the Mississippian period except for its image of a jaguar. The text goes on to explain that this is unusual because the jaguar’s range didn’t include Missouri. The Fairfield Gorget’s artist likely wouldn’t have encountered a live jaguar, but since such jaguar images were common in ancient Mexican art (and the jaguar’s range did include Mexico), perhaps some of that art inspired the gorget’s artist. Therefore, evidence that an ancient Mexican art object had been found at a site that was close to the Fairfield Gorget in both location and time period would strongly support the explanation that long-distance trade from Mexico took place during the Mississippian period and that jaguar imagery could have reached Missouri by those means.\nChoice A is incorrect. The underlined explanation indicates that Mexican artistic influence preceded the creation of the Fairfield Gorget. An artifact from Mexico that appeared in Missouri only after the gorget was created cannot support such a claim. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to whether the jaguar image on the Fairfield Gorget was suggested to the Mississippian artist who made it by encounters with depictions of jaguars in Mexican art. The appearance of jaguars in Missouri after the Mississippian period cannot provide evidence for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to influence that Mexican art might have had on Mississippian art, restricted to the period from 900 CE to 1600 CE.

In other words, they use technology to inspect small parts of matter that can’t be seen by the naked eye.\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time “selecting,” or choosing, subatomic particles for some purpose; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time “creating” subatomic particles, or bringing them into existence; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “deciding” would mean making a final choice or judgment about something. It wouldn’t make sense to say that particle physicists get to choose what is and isn’t visible to the naked eye, especially when the text presents it as fact that subatomic particles are “the smallest detectable parts of matter” and would therefore be invisible. The text focuses on Arce and El-Khadra’s close observation of those particles, not on any decisions they might make.",

Their category labels are placed below the plotting area, diagonally (about a 40° tilt), reading from left to right: “additive,” “neither additive nor subtractive,” “subtractive,” and “invalid.” Using the grid to read heights, the approximate values are: additive ≈ 581.0 (its top is just below the 600 line, about 19 units down), neither additive nor subtractive ≈ 176.0 (between 150 and 200, closer to 200), subtractive ≈ 70.0 (between 50 and 100, closer to 50), and invalid ≈ 374.0 (between 350 and 400, closer to 400).

This choice doesn’t support the claim. We are looking to prove that people suggested subtractive means of achieving improvements less often than other means, but this choice doesn’t address how often people made subtractive suggestions. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. Invalid responses were incomprehensible, so we can’t compare what they were suggesting to what was being suggested in subtractive responses. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. Fewer than 100 suggestions were coded as subtractive. 175 is the approximate number of suggestions coded as “neither additive or subtractive.”",

The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in one-volume compilations of Shakespeare’s complete plays. Philip Massinger’s style in the first and last acts of The Two Noble Kinsmen is an homage to Shakespeare’s style. A",
    "text_prompt_table_figure_options_answer_rationale": "Text 1 In 1916, H. Dugdale Sykes disputed claims that The Two Noble Kinsmen was coauthored by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious—Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered sufficient evidence of Fletcher’s authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger. Text 2 Scholars have accepted The Two Noble Kinsmen as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare’s complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the first act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts.   John Fletcher’s writing has a unique, readily identifiable style. The women characters in John Fletcher’s plays are similar to the women characters in Philip Massinger’s plays. The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in one-volume compilations of Shakespeare’s complete plays. Philip Massinger’s style in the first and last acts of The Two Noble Kinsmen is an homage to Shakespeare’s style. A Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 states that Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious because he had a distinct style in his other plays. Text 2 states that scholars generally agree “on the basis of style” that Fletcher wrote most of the three middle acts. Both texts imply that Fletcher’s writing has a unique, readily identifiable style that can be used to distinguish his work from others.\nChoice B is incorrect. While Text 1 refers to the women in Massinger plays, neither text compares the women of Fletcher’s plays to the women of Massinger’s plays. Text 2 doesn’t mention Massinger at all. Choice C is incorrect. Text 1 states that Sykes disputed that Shakespeare coauthored the play, and implied that it was coauthored by Fletcher and Massinger instead. Sykes, therefore, would disagree that The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in a Shakespeare compilation. Choice D is incorrect. Text 1 doesn’t suggest that Massinger was inspired by Shakespeare, and Text 2 doesn’t mention Massinger at all.",

Although we know that doors and windows were taxed during the Bourbon Restoration, we don’t have enough information to infer if doors and windows increased after this time. Choice D is incorrect.

In their study, which focused on a wild population of gelada monkeys ( Theropithecus gelada ) in Ethiopia, the researchers further reported that yawn contagion most commonly occurred in males and across different social groups instead of within a single social group.   It defines a phenomenon that is discussed in the text. It introduces a problem that is examined in the text. It makes a claim that is challenged in the text. It presents a hypothesis that is evaluated in the text. A Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the first sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence introduces what yawn contagion is, explaining that it occurs when an individual yawns in response to the yawn of another individual. The text goes on to describe Elisabetta Palagi and her colleagues’ study of this phenomenon in a wild population of gelada monkeys. According to the text, the study showed that wild primate populations experience yawn contagion and that the behavior occurs most commonly in male monkeys and across social groups. Thus, the function of the first sentence is to define the phenomenon of yawn contagion that is discussed in the text.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the first sentence introduces the text’s discussion of yawn contagion, it doesn’t present this behavior, or anything else, as a problem. Choice C is incorrect because the first sentence doesn’t present a claim but instead explains what yawn contagion is. Moreover, the text doesn’t challenge anything; it’s an informative text that describes the findings of a research study about yawning in wild primate populations. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text describes a scientific study, and most scientific studies are guided by a hypothesis, the text doesn’t say what Palagi and her colleagues’ hypothesis was; the text discusses their findings instead.",

    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “assumed” most nearly means acquired, or came to possess. The text portrays a character named Drowne carving a figure out of wood. At first “irregular and misty,” or haphazard and indistinct, the figure’s outline gradually showed “distincter grace and beauty” until the general design of the carved object “was now obvious to the common eye,” or plainly recognizable to anyone. In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful, beautiful, and clearly recognizable form.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can’t acknowledge its own precision. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wooden figure merely imitated, or mimicked, precision. Rather, the text suggests that as Drowne carved his wooden figure, it gradually became more precise. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean speculated, or supposed based on incomplete information, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can’t speculate about its own precision.",

    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sounds made by güiros. In this context, “variable” means able to change. The text begins by explaining that güiros are instruments made out of hollowed gourds with ridges cut into their sides and that players scrape the ridges with wooden sticks to produce sounds. The text goes on to say that güiros’ sounds can change depending on gourd thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of strokes the player uses, thus supporting the idea that the sounds created by these instruments are variable.\nChoice A is incorrect because “overlooked” means not being seen or noticed, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are overlooked or not noticed. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “powerful” would mean having a great ability to produce an effect. While it’s possible that the sounds produced by güiros have a strong effect on listeners, the text doesn’t discuss this aspect of their sounds. Choice C is incorrect because “routine” means usual and unvarying, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are unvarying.

    "text_prompt_table_figure_options_answer_rationale": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: Neuroscientists Krishnan Padmanabhan and Zhen Chen sought to better understand the workings of the brain’s olfactory system. They devised a study using mathematical models. They found that certain fibers allow the brain to toggle from one method of processing smells to another. In one method, cells in the piriform cortex (where the perception of odor forms) capture olfactory information at a given moment. In the other, the cells track changes in olfactory information over time.   To arrive at these findings, which describe dual methods of processing smells in the piriform cortex, Padmanabhan and Chen devised a study using mathematical models. Padmanabhan and Chen showed that olfactory information is captured by cells in the piriform cortex, where the perception of odor forms. Using mathematical models, Padmanabhan and Chen devised a study to better understand the workings of the brain’s olfactory system. According to Padmanabhan and Chen, the brain can toggle between capturing olfactory information at a given moment and tracking changes in that information over time. D Choice D is the best answer. The sentence effectively summarizes the study’s findings, explaining what Padmanabhan and Chen found: that the brain can toggle between one method of processing smells (capturing information at a given moment) and another (tracking changes in information over time).\nChoice A is incorrect. While the sentence mentions findings, it mainly focuses on Padmanabhan and Chen’s methodology. It doesn’t effectively summarize the study’s findings. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence notes a fact about the olfactory system—that the perception of odor forms in the piriform cortex—but doesn’t summarize the findings of Padmanabhan and Chen’s study. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence presents the goal of Padmanabhan and Chen’s study; it doesn’t summarize the study’s findings.",

    "Prompt": "The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde’s 1891 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray . Dorian Gray is taking his first look at a portrait that Hallward has painted of him. Dorian passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time.

All these details support the description of Dorian as being delighted by what he sees in the portrait.\nChoice A is incorrect because Dorian isn’t depicted as interested in Hallward’s opinion of the portrait but rather as so enraptured by the painting that he’s hardly even aware of Hallward. Choice C is incorrect because the portrait of Dorian is the only painting that is mentioned in the text, so there’s no evidence that Dorian prefers portraits to other types of paintings. Although Dorian is depicted as delighted with this particular portrait, there’s no way of knowing from the text whether he likes portraits better than other kinds of paintings.

By definition, literature tells a story or conveys meaning through language only; graphic novels tell stories through illustrations and use language only sparingly, in captions and dialogue. Graphic novels are experienced as series of images and not as language, making them more similar to film than to literature. Text 2 Graphic novels present their stories through both language and images. Without captions and dialogue, readers would be unable to understand what is depicted in the illustrations: the story results from the interaction of text and image. Moreover, Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home and many other graphic novels feature text that is as beautifully written as the prose found in many standard novels.

    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arguing that graphic novels shouldn’t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"—that is, comparatively very little—in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn’t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel’s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn’t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there’s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn’t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn’t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn’t imply that graphic novels aren’t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written—that is, well crafted—as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn’t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted.",

Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn’t imply that graphic novels aren’t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written—that is, well crafted—as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn’t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted.",

In arguing that graphic novels shouldn’t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"—that is, comparatively very little—in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn’t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel’s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn’t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there’s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn’t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn’t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn’t imply that graphic novels aren’t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written—that is, well crafted—as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn’t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted.",

    "Prompt": "To assess the impact of invasive species on ecosystems in Africa, Benis N. Egoh and colleagues reviewed government reports from those nations about how invasive species are undermining ecosystem services (aspects of the ecosystem on which residents depend). The services were sorted into three categories: provisioning (material resources from the ecosystem), regulating (natural processes such as cleaning the air or water), and cultural (nonmaterial benefits of ecosystems). Egoh and her team assert that countries in each region reported effects on provisioning services and that provisioning services represent the majority of the reported services.",
    "Table": "The table is titled “Distribution of Ecosystem Services Affected by Invasive Species by Service Type.” It presents data in a grid with four columns and six rows, including the header row. The columns are organized as follows: the first column lists regions, and the next three columns show percentages for different types of ecosystem services affected by invasive species.\n\nThe header row contains these exact column headings, each centered and aligned at the bottom:\n- “Region (Overall)”\n- “Provisioning (75%)”\n- “Regulating (21%)”\n- “Cultural (4%)”\n\nThe percentages in parentheses in the three service-type columns (75%, 21%, and 4%) appear to represent the overall proportion of each service type affected, though the table does not explicitly clarify this.\n\nThe body of the table lists five regions in the first column: West, North, South, East, and Central. For each region, the table provides the percentage of affected ecosystem services in each of the three categories (Provisioning, Regulating, Cultural). All data cells are centered.\n\nFor the “West” region, 73% of affected services are Provisioning, 27% are Regulating, and 0% are Cultural.

    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken the astronomers’ claim about the makeup of host stars and their planets. The text explains that because stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust, astronomers believe planets should be composed of the same materials as their host stars, but in equal or smaller quantities. The finding that the amount of iron in some rocky planets is much higher than the amount in their host star would weaken the astronomers’ claim because it would show that some planets contain the same material as their host star, but in higher quantities.\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding only about the makeup of stars, whether they’ve cooled or not, would provide no information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn’t have any bearing on the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about two host stars having similar proportions of certain materials wouldn’t provide any information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn’t be relevant to the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the astronomers’ claim is based on a fact—that stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust in space—which would remain true regardless of the effectiveness of a method for analysis of compositions. The text does cite analysis of rocky planets in our solar system and the Sun, but only as a single piece of evidence that is consistent with the claim and not as the source of the claim; the finding that the method used for that analysis is less effective in other scenarios wouldn’t weaken a claim that’s based on knowledge of how stars and planets initially form.",

The method for determining the composition of rocky planets is discovered to be less effective when used to analyze other kinds of planets. C Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken the astronomers’ claim about the makeup of host stars and their planets. The text explains that because stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust, astronomers believe planets should be composed of the same materials as their host stars, but in equal or smaller quantities. The finding that the amount of iron in some rocky planets is much higher than the amount in their host star would weaken the astronomers’ claim because it would show that some planets contain the same material as their host star, but in higher quantities.\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding only about the makeup of stars, whether they’ve cooled or not, would provide no information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn’t have any bearing on the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about two host stars having similar proportions of certain materials wouldn’t provide any information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn’t be relevant to the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the astronomers’ claim is based on a fact—that stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust in space—which would remain true regardless of the effectiveness of a method for analysis of compositions. The text does cite analysis of rocky planets in our solar system and the Sun, but only as a single piece of evidence that is consistent with the claim and not as the source of the claim; the finding that the method used for that analysis is less effective in other scenarios wouldn’t weaken a claim that’s based on knowledge of how stars and planets initially form.",

    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion that the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than shifting south during the Little Ice Age. The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru’s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted.\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth’s hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues’ claim. Choice B is incorrect because finding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion, not strengthen it.

To resolve the issue, geologist Yemane Asmerom and colleagues collected data from Yok Balum Cave in Central America and compared them with the Huagapo data. They concluded that during the Little Ice Age, the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifted.   Neither the Yok Balum data nor the Huagapo data show significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age. Both the Yok Balum data and the Huagapo data show increased temperatures and prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age. The Yok Balum data show prolonged dry conditions during the same portions of the Little Ice Age in which the Huagapo data show heightened levels of rainfall. The Yok Balum data and the Huagapo data show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age. D Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion that the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than shifting south during the Little Ice Age. The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru’s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted.\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth’s hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues’ claim. Choice B is incorrect because finding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion, not strengthen it. Such a finding would suggest that the ITCZ shifted south and left Central America dry rather than expanding both northward and southward.",

The text states that Hilton and her team interviewed participants about factors that would encourage them to switch from single-use plastic containers to reusable containers. The graph presents three factors mentioned in the interviews (convenience, costs, and established behaviors) and the percentage of participants who mentioned each one.

    "Question Text": "Which quotation from Barchester Towers most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    "A": "“It must not…be taken as proved that Dr. Proudie was a man of great mental powers, or even of much capacity for business, for such qualities had not been required in him.”",
    "B": "“[Dr. Proudie] was comparatively young, and had, as he fondly flattered himself, been selected as possessing such gifts, natural and acquired, as must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher notice.”",
    "C": "“[Dr. Proudie’s] residence in the metropolis, rendered necessary by duties thus entrusted to him, his high connexions, and the peculiar talents and nature of the man, recommended him to persons in power.”",
    "D": "“[Dr. Proudie] was certainly possessed of sufficient tact to answer the purpose for which he was required without making himself troublesome.”",
    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. In this quotation, Dr. Proudie is described as \"fondly flatter[ing] himself\" that he has gifts that \"must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher notice.\" In other words, he expects his skills to push him to greater fame and success. This implies an exaggerated sense of his own abilities, which matches the claim we’re trying to support.\nChoice A is incorrect. This quotation doesn’t describe Proudie’s view of himself, nor does it paint him in an especially flattering light. Instead, by saying his mental powers and business skill are not \"proved,\" it implies that he is actually dim-witted and bad at business. Choice C is incorrect. This choice describes Proudie’s closeness to power and importance, but it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself. Proudie is not describing himself or his abilities here. The narrator is. Choice D is incorrect. While this quotation offers Proudie very mild praise, it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself or his own abilities, which is what the claim focuses on.",

The student wants to contrast the number of meteorite falls with the number of meteorite finds. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal? A meteorite that was observed falling to Earth before being recovered is known as a meteorite fall; all others are known as meteorite finds. Meteorites found on Earth are divided into two categories: meteorite falls and meteorite finds. There have been about 1,200 recorded meteorite falls, or meteorites observed falling to Earth. While there have been only about 1,200 recorded meteorite falls, there have been over 60,000 meteorite finds. D Choice D is the best answer. The sentence contrasts the number of meteorite falls with the number of meteorite finds, noting that there have been over 60,000 meteorite finds but only about 1,200 recorded meteorite falls.\nChoice A is incorrect. While the sentence explains the difference between meteorite falls and meteorite finds, it doesn’t contrast the number of meteorite falls and meteorite finds. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence indicates the two categories of meteorites found on Earth; it doesn’t contrast the number of meteorite falls and meteorite finds. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence notes the number of recorded meteorite falls, it doesn’t contrast this with the number of meteorite finds.",

    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Johny Isla and the whalelike geoglyph. The text indicates that the German exhibit about the Nazca Lines included a photograph showing a whalelike geoglyph that Isla hadn’t known about before attending the exhibit, even though Isla “specializes in” Nazca Lines geoglyphs. Given his expertise, and his surprise at being unfamiliar with the whale glyph, the text strongly suggests that Isla believed he would have noticed the glyph if he had been to its location. Thus, the text implies that the whalelike geoglyph is likely in a location Isla had not previously been to.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address either the species of whale that the geoglyph is meant to represent or its relationship to the earliest humans in the area that is now Peru. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the photograph of the whalelike geoglyph was on display at a “German exhibit,” that exhibit was specifically “about the Nazca Lines,” which the text indicates are located in Peru. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that the glyphs were created “over a period of many centuries,” the text doesn’t address when in that period of time any particular glyphs were created.",

    "Figure": "The graphic is a bar chart titled “Participants’ Responses to Three Review Conditions,” shown in two centered lines at the top. The vertical axis at the left is labeled “Participants’ mean rating (1–9; higher values = more positive),” with the wording split across two stacked, rotated lines. The vertical scale displays tick labels from 0 at the bottom up to 7 at the top in increments of 1, with short tick marks next to the labels and horizontal grid lines spanning the plotting area at each integer value. The vertical axis line runs from the 0 line to the 7 line. The horizontal axis has no label. Two grouped categories appear along the horizontal direction, each labeled below the bars with rotated text: “Helpfulness of review” for the left group and “Attitude toward reviewed product” for the right group. All bars sit on the 0 baseline and extend upward; there are no negative values, error bars, or shaded regions.\n\nA legend in a bordered rectangle near the bottom center explains the three fills used for the bars: a medium gray square (fill #666666) labeled “no anger (control),” a light gray square (fill #CCCCCC) labeled “high anger,” and a black square (fill #000000) labeled “low anger.” Bars have a thin black outline of uniform thickness, and each group contains three adjacent bars of equal width, one in each of these fills.\n\nIn the “Helpfulness of review” group, the three bars reach high on the 0–7 scale. The medium gray (“no anger”) bar rises to about 6.8. The light gray (“high anger”) bar is lower, at about 6.1. The black (“low anger”) bar is the tallest in this group, at about 6.9. Thus, for this category, the black bar is about 0.1 higher than the medium gray bar and about 0.8 higher than the light gray bar; the medium gray bar is about 0.7 higher than the light gray bar.\n\nIn the “Attitude toward reviewed product” group, all three bars are near the lower part of the scale. The medium gray (“no anger”) bar reaches about 2.2. The light gray (“high anger”) bar is lower, at about 1.8. The black (“low anger”) bar is just below the medium gray bar at about 2.2, roughly 0.1 shorter than the medium gray bar.

    "Question Text": "Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the students’ conclusion?",
    "A": "On average, participants’ ratings of the helpfulness of the review were substantially higher than were participants’ ratings of the reviewed product regardless of which type of review participants had seen.",

The vertical axis at the left is labeled “Participants’ mean rating (1–9; higher values = more positive),” with the wording split across two stacked, rotated lines. The vertical scale displays tick labels from 0 at the bottom up to 7 at the top in increments of 1, with short tick marks next to the labels and horizontal grid lines spanning the plotting area at each integer value. The vertical axis line runs from the 0 line to the 7 line. The horizontal axis has no label. Two grouped categories appear along the horizontal direction, each labeled below the bars with rotated text: “Helpfulness of review” for the left group and “Attitude toward reviewed product” for the right group. All bars sit on the 0 baseline and extend upward; there are no negative values, error bars, or shaded regions.\n\nA legend in a bordered rectangle near the bottom center explains the three fills used for the bars: a medium gray square (fill #666666) labeled “no anger (control),” a light gray square (fill #CCCCCC) labeled “high anger,” and a black square (fill #000000) labeled “low anger.” Bars have a thin black outline of uniform thickness, and each group contains three adjacent bars of equal width, one in each of these fills.\n\nIn the “Helpfulness of review” group, the three bars reach high on the 0–7 scale. The medium gray (“no anger”) bar rises to about 6.8. The light gray (“high anger”) bar is lower, at about 6.1. The black (“low anger”) bar is the tallest in this group, at about 6.9. Thus, for this category, the black bar is about 0.1 higher than the medium gray bar and about 0.8 higher than the light gray bar; the medium gray bar is about 0.7 higher than the light gray bar.\n\nIn the “Attitude toward reviewed product” group, all three bars are near the lower part of the scale. The medium gray (“no anger”) bar reaches about 2.2. The light gray (“high anger”) bar is lower, at about 1.8. The black (“low anger”) bar is just below the medium gray bar at about 2.2, roughly 0.1 shorter than the medium gray bar. In this group, both the medium gray and black bars are higher than the light gray bar by about 0.4, and the medium gray is the tallest by a small margin. Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the students’ conclusion? On average, participants’ ratings of the helpfulness of the review were substantially higher than were participants’ ratings of the reviewed product regardless of which type of review participants had seen. Compared with participants who saw the control review, participants who saw the low-anger review rated the review as slightly more helpful, whereas participants who saw the high-anger review rated the review as less helpful. Participants who saw the low-anger review rated the review as slightly more helpful than participants who saw the control review did, but participants’ attitude toward the reviewed product was slightly worse when participants saw the low-anger review than when they saw the no-anger review. Compared with participants who saw the low-anger review, participants who saw the high-anger review rated the review as less helpful and had a less positive attitude toward the reviewed product. B Choice B is the best answer. The claim is that low anger does not negatively affect readers’ perceptions of the review, while high anger does negatively affect readers’ perceptions of the review. This choice accurately expresses the supporting data from the “helpfulness of review” part of the graph: that low-anger reviews were rated as slightly more helpful than no-anger reviews, while high-anger reviews were rated as less helpful than no-anger reviews.\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice does not support the conclusion. The conclusion is only about how participants feel about the review itself—the participants’ ratings of the reviewed product are not relevant. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not support the conclusion. The conclusion is only about how participants feel about the review itself—the participants’ attitude towards the reviewed product is not relevant. Choice D is incorrect. This choice does not support the conclusion. The conclusion is only about how participants feel about the review itself—the participants’ attitude towards the reviewed product is not relevant.",

    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between the first sentence (“On…temperature”) and the second sentence (“Adding…effect”). The gerund phrase beginning with “adding” is the subject of the second sentence, and the verb phrase “helps combat this effect” describes what adding a light-colored covering can do.\nChoice A is incorrect because a semicolon can’t be used in this way to join the sentence “On...temperature” and the supplementary phrases that follow. Doing so leaves the verb phrase “helps combat” without a subject and thus results in a grammatically unconventional sentence. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that adding a light-colored covering to an existing dark roof raises the temperature of the surrounding air. Furthermore, it creates ambiguity by leaving the verb phrase “helps combat” without a subject (so it isn’t clear what helps combat the effect).",

Adding temperature by adding C Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between the first sentence (“On…temperature”) and the second sentence (“Adding…effect”). The gerund phrase beginning with “adding” is the subject of the second sentence, and the verb phrase “helps combat this effect” describes what adding a light-colored covering can do.\nChoice A is incorrect because a semicolon can’t be used in this way to join the sentence “On...temperature” and the supplementary phrases that follow. Doing so leaves the verb phrase “helps combat” without a subject and thus results in a grammatically unconventional sentence. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that adding a light-colored covering to an existing dark roof raises the temperature of the surrounding air.

The text indicates that to achieve this aim, Francie works systematically and persistently: she reads all the books in the library in alphabetical order and devotes much time and effort to the project, finishing one book per day over a long period of time.

Although the text mentions several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) that Francie has read about, it doesn’t indicate that any of these topics are unusual or that she especially enjoyed reading about one of these topics in particular. If anything, the text suggests that she may have found some of these topics to be dull, saying that she even read the \"dry ones\"—that is, the boring books—and that some of the books were \"hard going,\" meaning they were difficult to get through. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss Francie’s involvement in other activities, only her dedication to reading. Although it’s possible that Francie dedicates herself to reading because she prefers it to other activities, the text doesn’t indicate whether this is the case. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions one author (Abbott) whose book Francie has read as well as several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) she has encountered, the text doesn’t say whether Francie admires any of the books she’s read so far.

    "Prompt": "Rows in table may not add up to 100 due to rounding. Over the past two hundred years, the percentage of the population employed in the agricultural sector has declined in both France and the United States, while employment in the service sector (which includes jobs in retail, consulting, real estate, etc.) has risen. However, this transition happened at very different rates in the two countries. This can be seen most clearly by comparing the employment by sector in both countries in ______ blank",
    "Table": "The table is titled “Employment by Sector in France and the United States, 1800–2012 (% of total employment)” and presents data on the percentage of total employment in three sectors—Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services—for both France and the United States, across four years: 1800, 1900, 1950, and 2012.\n\nThe table consists of seven columns and five rows (including the header row). The columns are as follows:\n\n1. **Year**\n2. **Agriculture in France**\n3. **Manufacturing in France**\n4. **Services in France**\n5. **Agriculture in US**\n6. **Manufacturing in US**\n7. **Services in US**\n\nThe header row lists these column names, each centered both horizontally and vertically. There are no multi-level headers or merged cells; each column header is distinct and applies to a single column.\n\nEach subsequent row corresponds to a specific year (1800, 1900, 1950, 2012), listed in the first column. For each year, the table provides the percentage of total employment in each sector for both countries. All data cells are centered.\n\n**Detailed breakdown by year:**\n\n- **1800:**\n  - Agriculture in France: 64%\n  - Manufacturing in France: 22%\n  - Services in France: 14%\n  - Agriculture in US: 68%\n  - Manufacturing in US: 18%\n  - Services in US: 13%\n  - In both countries, agriculture accounts for the majority of employment, with the US slightly higher (68%) than France (64%). Manufacturing and services are both lower, with France having a higher percentage in manufacturing (22% vs. 18%) and services (14% vs. 13%).\n\n- **1900:**\n  - Agriculture in France: 43%\n  - Manufacturing in France: 29%\n  - Services in France: 28%\n  - Agriculture in US: 41%\n  - Manufacturing in US: 28%\n  - Services in US: 31%\n  - Both countries show a significant decrease in agricultural employment compared to 1800. Manufacturing and services have increased, with services in the US (31%) slightly higher than in France (28%).\n\n- **1950:**\n  - Agriculture in France: 32%\n  - Manufacturing in France: 33%\n  - Services in France: 35%\n  - Agriculture in US: 14%\n  - Manufacturing in US: 33%\n  - Services in US: 53%\n  - In France, employment is distributed more evenly across the three sectors, with services slightly leading. In the US, agriculture has dropped sharply to 14%, manufacturing matches France at 33%, and services have become the dominant sector at 53%.\n\n- **2012:**\n  - Agriculture in France: 3%\n  - Manufacturing in France: 21%\n  - Services in France: 76%\n  - Agriculture in US: 2%\n  - Manufacturing in US: 18%\n  - Services in US: 80%\n  - By 2012, both countries have very low agricultural employment (3% in France, 2% in the US). Manufacturing has also declined (21% in France, 18% in the US), while services dominate (76% in France, 80% in the US).\n\nThere are no missing values, special symbols, footnotes, or notes in the table. All values are whole numbers representing percentages, and each row’s sector percentages sum to 100% for both countries in every year. The data shows a clear trend over time: a decline in agricultural employment, a rise and then decline in manufacturing, and a substantial increase in service sector employment in both countries.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?",
    "A": "1900 with the employment by sector in 1950.",
    "B": "1800 with the employment by sector in 2012.",
    "C": "1900 with the employment by sector in 2012.",
    "D": "1800 with the employment by sector in 1900.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents data from the table that most effectively complete the statement about the rates at which employment shifted in France and the United States. The text states that over the last two hundred years employment in the agricultural sector has declined while employment in the service sector has risen in both France and the US, and the data from the table reflect these trends. The text asserts, however, that the transition from agriculture to services “happened at very different rates in the two countries.” This assertion is best supported by a comparison of data from 1900 and 1950: the table shows that in those years, employment in agriculture went from 43% to 32% in France (a decline of 11 percentage points) and from 41% to 14% in the US (a decline of 27 percentage points), and that employment in services went from 28% to 35% in France (an increase of 7 percentage points) and from 31% to 53% in the US (an increase of 22 percentage points). In other words, the rate of change was greater in the US than in France for both sectors.\nChoice B is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice C is incorrect because comparing the data for 1900 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries rather than very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 43% in 1900 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 41% in 1900 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 28% in 1900 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 31% in 1900 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice D is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 1900 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 43% in 1900 in France, which is fairly close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 41% in 1900 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 28% in 1900 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 31% in 1900 in the US.",

A Choice A is the best answer because it presents data from the table that most effectively complete the statement about the rates at which employment shifted in France and the United States. The text states that over the last two hundred years employment in the agricultural sector has declined while employment in the service sector has risen in both France and the US, and the data from the table reflect these trends. The text asserts, however, that the transition from agriculture to services “happened at very different rates in the two countries.” This assertion is best supported by a comparison of data from 1900 and 1950: the table shows that in those years, employment in agriculture went from 43% to 32% in France (a decline of 11 percentage points) and from 41% to 14% in the US (a decline of 27 percentage points), and that employment in services went from 28% to 35% in France (an increase of 7 percentage points) and from 31% to 53% in the US (an increase of 22 percentage points). In other words, the rate of change was greater in the US than in France for both sectors.\nChoice B is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice C is incorrect because comparing the data for 1900 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries rather than very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 43% in 1900 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 41% in 1900 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 28% in 1900 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 31% in 1900 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice D is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 1900 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 43% in 1900 in France, which is fairly close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 41% in 1900 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 28% in 1900 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 31% in 1900 in the US.",

    "text_prompt_table_figure_options_answer_rationale": "Rows in table may not add up to 100 due to rounding. Over the past two hundred years, the percentage of the population employed in the agricultural sector has declined in both France and the United States, while employment in the service sector (which includes jobs in retail, consulting, real estate, etc.) has risen. However, this transition happened at very different rates in the two countries. This can be seen most clearly by comparing the employment by sector in both countries in ______ blank The table is titled “Employment by Sector in France and the United States, 1800–2012 (% of total employment)” and presents data on the percentage of total employment in three sectors—Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services—for both France and the United States, across four years: 1800, 1900, 1950, and 2012.\n\nThe table consists of seven columns and five rows (including the header row). The columns are as follows:\n\n1. **Year**\n2. **Agriculture in France**\n3. **Manufacturing in France**\n4. **Services in France**\n5. **Agriculture in US**\n6. **Manufacturing in US**\n7. **Services in US**\n\nThe header row lists these column names, each centered both horizontally and vertically. There are no multi-level headers or merged cells; each column header is distinct and applies to a single column.\n\nEach subsequent row corresponds to a specific year (1800, 1900, 1950, 2012), listed in the first column. For each year, the table provides the percentage of total employment in each sector for both countries. All data cells are centered.\n\n**Detailed breakdown by year:**\n\n- **1800:**\n  - Agriculture in France: 64%\n  - Manufacturing in France: 22%\n  - Services in France: 14%\n  - Agriculture in US: 68%\n  - Manufacturing in US: 18%\n  - Services in US: 13%\n  - In both countries, agriculture accounts for the majority of employment, with the US slightly higher (68%) than France (64%). Manufacturing and services are both lower, with France having a higher percentage in manufacturing (22% vs. 18%) and services (14% vs. 13%).\n\n- **1900:**\n  - Agriculture in France: 43%\n  - Manufacturing in France: 29%\n  - Services in France: 28%\n  - Agriculture in US: 41%\n  - Manufacturing in US: 28%\n  - Services in US: 31%\n  - Both countries show a significant decrease in agricultural employment compared to 1800. Manufacturing and services have increased, with services in the US (31%) slightly higher than in France (28%).\n\n- **1950:**\n  - Agriculture in France: 32%\n  - Manufacturing in France: 33%\n  - Services in France: 35%\n  - Agriculture in US: 14%\n  - Manufacturing in US: 33%\n  - Services in US: 53%\n  - In France, employment is distributed more evenly across the three sectors, with services slightly leading. In the US, agriculture has dropped sharply to 14%, manufacturing matches France at 33%, and services have become the dominant sector at 53%.\n\n- **2012:**\n  - Agriculture in France: 3%\n  - Manufacturing in France: 21%\n  - Services in France: 76%\n  - Agriculture in US: 2%\n  - Manufacturing in US: 18%\n  - Services in US: 80%\n  - By 2012, both countries have very low agricultural employment (3% in France, 2% in the US). Manufacturing has also declined (21% in France, 18% in the US), while services dominate (76% in France, 80% in the US).\n\nThere are no missing values, special symbols, footnotes, or notes in the table. All values are whole numbers representing percentages, and each row’s sector percentages sum to 100% for both countries in every year. The data shows a clear trend over time: a decline in agricultural employment, a rise and then decline in manufacturing, and a substantial increase in service sector employment in both countries.  1900 with the employment by sector in 1950. 1800 with the employment by sector in 2012. 1900 with the employment by sector in 2012. 1800 with the employment by sector in 1900. A Choice A is the best answer because it presents data from the table that most effectively complete the statement about the rates at which employment shifted in France and the United States. The text states that over the last two hundred years employment in the agricultural sector has declined while employment in the service sector has risen in both France and the US, and the data from the table reflect these trends. The text asserts, however, that the transition from agriculture to services “happened at very different rates in the two countries.” This assertion is best supported by a comparison of data from 1900 and 1950: the table shows that in those years, employment in agriculture went from 43% to 32% in France (a decline of 11 percentage points) and from 41% to 14% in the US (a decline of 27 percentage points), and that employment in services went from 28% to 35% in France (an increase of 7 percentage points) and from 31% to 53% in the US (an increase of 22 percentage points). In other words, the rate of change was greater in the US than in France for both sectors.\nChoice B is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice C is incorrect because comparing the data for 1900 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries rather than very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 43% in 1900 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 41% in 1900 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 28% in 1900 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 31% in 1900 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice D is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 1900 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 43% in 1900 in France, which is fairly close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 41% in 1900 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 28% in 1900 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 31% in 1900 in the US.",

The 1,600 articles published in 2013 was the largest annual number of investigative articles published during the period. Also, notice that the claim focuses on an overall change, while this choice just focuses on one year. We can’t determine an overall increase or decrease by looking at just one year. Choice C is incorrect. The 1,000 articles published in 2017 wasn’t the largest number published during the period. Also, notice that the claim focuses on an overall change, while this choice just focuses on one year. We can’t determine an overall increase or decrease by looking at just one year.

The vertical axis is labeled “Number of articles,” running from 0 at the bottom to 1,750 at the top in increments of 250, with tick labels at 0, 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,250, 1,500, and 1,750. Horizontal reference lines span the plot at each vertical tick mark (including at the top for 1,750 and the bottom for 0), and short tick marks appear on the left of each. Vertical reference lines also run from top to bottom at each year tick. The plotting area spans approximately from y = 296 (0) up to y = 96 (1,750). The y‑axis title appears vertically along the left margin.\n\nThere is a single data series rendered as a black polyline drawn as separate straight segments between consecutive years. Each segment has black triangular arrowheads at both ends, and the line stroke is relatively thick (about 2.4 units). A small boxed legend beneath the chart shows two short horizontal arrows meeting tip to tip, labeled “Total,” indicating the series style; the legend box is centered below the plot area and contains the word “Total” to the right of the arrows.\n\nReading values from the vertical scale, the series starts at about 1,076.0 in 2010, rises to 1,189.0 in 2011, increases further to 1,496.0 in 2012, and reaches a local peak of 1,600.0 in 2013. It then drops to 998.0 in 2014, declines again to 903.0 in 2015 and to 814.0 in 2016. In 2017 it rebounds to 1,115.0, then falls to 872.0 in 2018 and to 465.0 in 2019, the lowest value shown.

By comparing the number of investigative articles in 2010 to the number in 2019, we can see that the number has fallen overall.\nChoice B is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The 1,600 articles published in 2013 was the largest annual number of investigative articles published during the period. Also, notice that the claim focuses on an overall change, while this choice just focuses on one year. We can’t determine an overall increase or decrease by looking at just one year. Choice C is incorrect. The 1,000 articles published in 2017 wasn’t the largest number published during the period. Also, notice that the claim focuses on an overall change, while this choice just focuses on one year. We can’t determine an overall increase or decrease by looking at just one year. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t justify the claim. The claim is about a decrease in articles published between 2010 and 2019.

    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker of the poem describes experiencing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. In this quotation, the speaker notes that as years go by, “Each, coming”—that is, each new year as it comes—“brings ambitions high.” In other words, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (“each, departing”), it “leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.” A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole quotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reflects on not having achieved the ambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases “the years go swiftly by,” “Each, coming,” and “each, departing” indicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection.\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has occurred at midnight. Specifically, the speaker has heard a “brazen tongue,” a figurative way of saying that the speaker has heard the clang of a bronze bell being rung. Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of anticipation through its reference to “ominous stillness,” there is no suggestion of regretful reflection or any indication that the speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reflection. Instead, the speaker is describing a particular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of regret (“many a squandered day”), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regret. Instead, the speaker is simply lamenting wasted time and opportunities.",

The text indicates that the team found several instances of the appendix emerging and not disappearing in the lineages of various mammal species the team examined. Furthermore, the text states that species that possess an appendix also tend to have relatively high amounts of lymphoid tissue—a type of tissue that supports immune system function. Taken together, these details strongly support the hypothesis that the appendix has persisted in some species because it has a function that contributes to effective immune responses in those species.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address any nonmammalian species.

Smith and her team investigated the evolution of the appendix, an intestinal organ that is present in some mammals, including humans, but is generally thought to have no function. Studying 533 mammal species, the team found that the appendix has emerged independently across multiple lineages in separate instances and, significantly, hasn’t disappeared after emerging in specific lineages. Moreover, the team determined that species with the organ tend to have higher concentrations of lymphoid tissue, which supports immune responses, in the cecum, the organ the appendix is attached to. Therefore, the team hypothesized that the appendix likely ______ blank   was once present in many nonmammal species but has since disappeared from those lineages. has been preserved in certain mammal species because it benefits their immune systems. will emerge in a greater number of mammal species because it may serve a necessary function in the immune system. produced higher concentrations of lymphoid tissue in mammals in the past than it does currently. B Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Smith and colleagues’ investigation of the evolution and biological role of the appendix. The text indicates that the team found several instances of the appendix emerging and not disappearing in the lineages of various mammal species the team examined. Furthermore, the text states that species that possess an appendix also tend to have relatively high amounts of lymphoid tissue—a type of tissue that supports immune system function. Taken together, these details strongly support the hypothesis that the appendix has persisted in some species because it has a function that contributes to effective immune responses in those species.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address any nonmammalian species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t make predictions about the evolutionary future of the species Smith and colleagues examined, and although the implication of the text is that the appendix likely does serve a function for the immune system, nothing in the text indicates that the appendix will become more widespread in the future. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does suggest an association between having an appendix and relatively high concentrations of lymphoid tissue, it doesn’t claim that the appendix causes the tissue to grow, nor does it address the relative production of the tissue at different periods of time.",

A comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction \"and\" can’t be used in this way to join sentences.",

They can’t know. In one sense of the word it is of course necessary to know oneself: that is the first achievement of knowledge. But to recognise that the soul of a man is unknowable, is the ultimate achievement of wisdom. The final mystery is oneself.

Choice C is incorrect because the future tense verb \"will affect\" doesn’t indicate that the dust storms occurred in the 1930s.",

    "Prompt": "The recent discovery of a carved wooden figure dating to around 2,000 years ago in a ditch in England was truly surprising. Wooden objects ______ blank survive for so long due to their high susceptibility to rot, but archaeologists suspect layers of sediment in the ditch preserved the figure by creating an oxygen-free environment.",

    "B": "carelessly",
    "C": "rarely",
    "D": "simply",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the discovery of a carved wooden figure dating to around 2,000 years ago. In this context, “rarely” means infrequently. The text states that the discovery of the figure was “truly surprising” and notes that wooden objects are highly prone to rot. This context conveys the idea that wooden objects infrequently survive for as long as the carved figure has survived.\nChoice A is incorrect because “sturdily” means strongly, which wouldn’t make sense in context. If wooden objects in general could strongly survive for long periods of time, then the discovery of a wooden figure that’s around 2,000 years old wouldn’t be surprising. Choice B is incorrect because “carelessly” means accidentally. The text conveys the idea that wooden objects in general don’t survive for very long because they rot, not that wooden objects in general accidentally survive despite this. Choice D is incorrect because the text conveys the idea that wooden objects in general don’t survive for very long because they rot, not that wooden objects in general “simply,” or merely, survive for long periods of time. If wooden objects in general could merely survive for as long as the figure has survived, then the discovery of the figure wouldn’t have been surprising.",

Critics have noted the way pioneering ______ blank compares the experiences of issei (Japanese nationals who emigrated to America) and nisei (their American-born children).   playwright, Wakako Yamauchi, playwright, Wakako Yamauchi playwright Wakako Yamauchi, playwright Wakako Yamauchi D Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation between titles and proper nouns. No punctuation is needed to set off the proper noun \"Wakako Yamauchi\" from the title that describes Yamauchi, \"pioneering playwright.\" Because \"Wakako Yamauchi\" is essential information identifying the \"pioneering playwright,\" no punctuation is necessary.\nChoice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed before or after the proper noun \"Wakako Yamauchi.\" Setting the playwright’s name off with commas suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn’t the case. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the title \"pioneering playwright\" and the proper noun \"Wakako Yamauchi.\" Choice C is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the proper noun \"Wakako Yamauchi\" and the verb \"compares.\"",

    "Prompt": "Native to Latin America, the cane toad was introduced to Australia in the 1930s. In recent decades, tadpoles in the Australian population have been shown to consume eggs of their own species. A 2022 study showed that when presented with cane toad eggs as well as eggs of native Australian amphibians, cane toad tadpoles disproportionately consumed eggs of their own species. This behavior results from their attraction to bufadienolide, a chemical produced by the eggs of cane toads but not by the eggs of native amphibians. However, using data from this study, a student wishes to argue that the presence of bufadienolide doesn’t entirely explain the cane toad tadpoles’ preference for certain eggs over others.",
    "Table": "The table is titled \"Percentage of Available Eggs Eaten by Cane Toad Tadpoles\" and presents data in a structured format with four columns and five rows of data (excluding the header row). The columns are as follows:\n\n1. **Amphibian species (common name)**: This column lists the common names of five different amphibian species. Each species name appears in its own row, aligned to the left.\n2. **Percentage of eggs eaten**: This column shows the percentage of available eggs eaten by cane toad tadpoles for each species. The values are presented as percentages and are centered within their cells.\n3. **Native to Australia**: This column indicates whether each species is native to Australia, with entries of \"yes\" or \"no\".\n4. **Produces bufadienolide**: This column states whether each species produces bufadienolide, with entries of \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nThe five amphibian species listed, in order, are:\n- Little red tree frog\n- Cane toad\n- Short-footed frog\n- Striped burrowing frog\n- Dainty green tree frog\n\nFor the **Percentage of eggs eaten** column, the values are:\n- Little red tree frog: 1%\n- Cane toad: 90%\n- Short-footed frog: 7%\n- Striped burrowing frog: 10%\n- Dainty green tree frog: 1%\n\nThe **Native to Australia** column shows that all species except the cane toad are native to Australia (\"yes\"), while the cane toad is not (\"no\").\n\nThe **Produces bufadienolide** column indicates that only the cane toad produces bufadienolide (\"yes\"); all other species are marked \"no\".\n\nNotably, the cane toad stands out with a much higher percentage of eggs eaten (90%) compared to the other species, all of which have values of 10% or less.

    "C": "The tadpoles consumed a lower percentage of the short-footed frog eggs than they did of the eggs of their own species.",
    "D": "The tadpoles consumed the same percentage of the dainty green tree frog eggs as they did of the little red tree frog eggs.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the student’s argument about the role of bufadienolide in the egg preferences of cane toad tadpoles. For each of five amphibian species included in the 2022 study, the table gives the percentage of available eggs that the cane toad tadpoles ate. According to the table, the tadpoles ate 10% of striped burrowing frog eggs and 1% of dainty green tree frog eggs, which suggests a preference for striped burrowing frog eggs over dainty green tree frog eggs. The table also indicates that neither of these species’ eggs produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data suggest that something other than the presence or absence of bufadienolide is needed to adequately explain the tadpoles’ egg preferences.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the table shows that for each of the five amphibian species, the cane toad tadpoles ate less than 100% of that species’ eggs, which demonstrates that the tadpoles did indeed leave some eggs for each species unharmed, this fact alone is irrelevant to the tadpoles’ preferences for some species’ eggs over other species’ eggs. Choice C is incorrect. Although the table indicates that the cane toad tadpoles ate 90% of the cane toad eggs and 7% of the short-footed frog eggs, which suggests that they prefer cane toad eggs over short-footed frog eggs, the table also indicates that cane toad eggs produce bufadienolide, whereas short-footed frog eggs do not. Therefore, these data are not sufficient to exclude that bufadienolide alone could explain the tadpoles’ preference for some species’ eggs over other species’ eggs. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that for both dainty green tree frog eggs and little red tree frog eggs, the cane toad tadpoles ate 1% of those species’ eggs, it also indicates that neither produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data alone don’t indicate bufadienolide’s role in the tadpoles’ egg preferences.",

The columns are as follows:\n\n1. **Amphibian species (common name)**: This column lists the common names of five different amphibian species. Each species name appears in its own row, aligned to the left.\n2. **Percentage of eggs eaten**: This column shows the percentage of available eggs eaten by cane toad tadpoles for each species. The values are presented as percentages and are centered within their cells.\n3. **Native to Australia**: This column indicates whether each species is native to Australia, with entries of \"yes\" or \"no\".\n4. **Produces bufadienolide**: This column states whether each species produces bufadienolide, with entries of \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nThe five amphibian species listed, in order, are:\n- Little red tree frog\n- Cane toad\n- Short-footed frog\n- Striped burrowing frog\n- Dainty green tree frog\n\nFor the **Percentage of eggs eaten** column, the values are:\n- Little red tree frog: 1%\n- Cane toad: 90%\n- Short-footed frog: 7%\n- Striped burrowing frog: 10%\n- Dainty green tree frog: 1%\n\nThe **Native to Australia** column shows that all species except the cane toad are native to Australia (\"yes\"), while the cane toad is not (\"no\").\n\nThe **Produces bufadienolide** column indicates that only the cane toad produces bufadienolide (\"yes\"); all other species are marked \"no\".\n\nNotably, the cane toad stands out with a much higher percentage of eggs eaten (90%) compared to the other species, all of which have values of 10% or less. The little red tree frog and the dainty green tree frog both have the lowest value at 1%. There are no missing values, symbols, footnotes, or special formatting beyond text alignment and the bolding of header cells. There are no subtotals, totals, or averages presented in the table. Which choice best describes data from the table that support the student’s argument? The tadpoles consumed a higher percentage of the striped burrowing frog eggs than they did of the eggs of the dainty green tree frog. The tadpoles left a certain percentage of the eggs of each of the five species unharmed, thus ultimately allowing them to hatch. The tadpoles consumed a lower percentage of the short-footed frog eggs than they did of the eggs of their own species. The tadpoles consumed the same percentage of the dainty green tree frog eggs as they did of the little red tree frog eggs. A Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the student’s argument about the role of bufadienolide in the egg preferences of cane toad tadpoles. For each of five amphibian species included in the 2022 study, the table gives the percentage of available eggs that the cane toad tadpoles ate. According to the table, the tadpoles ate 10% of striped burrowing frog eggs and 1% of dainty green tree frog eggs, which suggests a preference for striped burrowing frog eggs over dainty green tree frog eggs. The table also indicates that neither of these species’ eggs produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data suggest that something other than the presence or absence of bufadienolide is needed to adequately explain the tadpoles’ egg preferences.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the table shows that for each of the five amphibian species, the cane toad tadpoles ate less than 100% of that species’ eggs, which demonstrates that the tadpoles did indeed leave some eggs for each species unharmed, this fact alone is irrelevant to the tadpoles’ preferences for some species’ eggs over other species’ eggs. Choice C is incorrect. Although the table indicates that the cane toad tadpoles ate 90% of the cane toad eggs and 7% of the short-footed frog eggs, which suggests that they prefer cane toad eggs over short-footed frog eggs, the table also indicates that cane toad eggs produce bufadienolide, whereas short-footed frog eggs do not. Therefore, these data are not sufficient to exclude that bufadienolide alone could explain the tadpoles’ preference for some species’ eggs over other species’ eggs. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that for both dainty green tree frog eggs and little red tree frog eggs, the cane toad tadpoles ate 1% of those species’ eggs, it also indicates that neither produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data alone don’t indicate bufadienolide’s role in the tadpoles’ egg preferences.",

    "text_prompt_table_figure_options_answer_rationale": "Polyphenols are organic compounds ______ blank among their many roles, provide pigment that helps protect plants against ultraviolet radiation from sunlight.   that— that; that, that: C Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementary element within a sentence. The comma after “that” pairs with the comma after “roles” to separate the supplementary element “among their many roles” from the rest of the sentence. This supplementary element functions to clarify that polyphenols have many roles, and the pair of commas indicates that this element could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.\nChoice A is incorrect because a dash can’t be paired with a comma to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence. Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can’t be paired with a comma to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence. Choice D is incorrect because a colon can’t be paired with a comma to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.",

Louis Pipestone is collecting signatures for a petition from fellow members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa on the tribe’s reservation in North Dakota. Louis Pipestone tended the petition like a garden. He kept it with him at all times. In town, his eyes sharpened when he noticed a tribal member who hadn’t yet signed. Wherever they were—at the gas pump, mercantile [general store], at Henry’s [Café], on the road, or outside the clinic and hospital—Louis cornered them.

    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the text’s main purpose. The text indicates that Louis always had his petition with him, asked everyone he encountered to sign it if they hadn’t already, and lists several comical circumstances in which he might try to get someone to sign. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Louis’s dedicated focus on getting people to sign the petition.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Louis was aggressive in seeking signatures for the petition—for example, saying that he \"cornered\" people—nothing in the text addresses how those people feel toward Louis, let alone that they are refusing his request. Choice B is incorrect because, other than portraying Louis’s commitment to gathering signatures, the text doesn’t discuss community members’ attitudes toward Louis or the petition. Choice C is incorrect because the text never mentions the attitudes of the people Louis approaches toward the petition, but the text does indicate that he \"cornered\" prospective signatories, strongly suggesting that their enthusiasm was neither needed nor considered.",

To suggest that some tribal members refuse to sign the petition because they dislike Louis Pipestone To show that attitudes toward the petition within the tribal community change over time To demonstrate that most tribal members are enthusiastic about signing the petition To portray Louis Pipestone’s strong commitment to collecting signatures for the petition D Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the text’s main purpose. The text indicates that Louis always had his petition with him, asked everyone he encountered to sign it if they hadn’t already, and lists several comical circumstances in which he might try to get someone to sign. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Louis’s dedicated focus on getting people to sign the petition.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Louis was aggressive in seeking signatures for the petition—for example, saying that he \"cornered\" people—nothing in the text addresses how those people feel toward Louis, let alone that they are refusing his request. Choice B is incorrect because, other than portraying Louis’s commitment to gathering signatures, the text doesn’t discuss community members’ attitudes toward Louis or the petition. Choice C is incorrect because the text never mentions the attitudes of the people Louis approaches toward the petition, but the text does indicate that he \"cornered\" prospective signatories, strongly suggesting that their enthusiasm was neither needed nor considered.",

    "Question Text": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    "A": "Although it may seem surprising that foreign investment declines in developing countries as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of those countries’ economies, that decline happens because resource extraction requires initial investments too large for foreign investors to supply.",

    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, contrary to what some might expect, foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction. The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid.\nChoice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect.

    "Prompt": "In the “language nest” model of education, Indigenous children learn the language of their people by using it as the medium of instruction and socialization at pre-K or elementary levels. In their 2016 study of a school in an Anishinaabe community in Ontario, Canada, scholars Lindsay Morcom and Stephanie Roy (who are Anishinaabe themselves) found that the model not only imparted fluency in the Anishinaabe language but also enhanced students’ pride in Anishinaabe culture overall. Given these positive effects, Morcom and Roy predict that the model increases the probability that as adults, former students of the school will transmit the language to younger generations in their community.",
    "Question Text": "Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the researchers’ prediction?",
    "A": "Anishinaabe adults who didn’t attend the school feel roughly the same degree of cultural pride as the former students of the school feel.",

    "D": "As they complete secondary and higher education, former students of the school experience no loss of fluency or cultural pride.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers’ prediction about the language nest model of education. The text states that Morcom and Roy studied the effects of the language nest model of education on students at an Anishinaabe school, and they found that the model—which is used with students during pre-K or elementary school—increased students’ fluency in the Anishinaabe language and pride in Anishinaabe culture. The researchers predicted that the students’ positive early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them to be more likely to later share the language with younger generations. If former students maintain full fluency and cultural pride after finishing secondary and higher education, it follows that they would be both able and motivated to share what they know with others; this would likely result in a higher probability of transmitting the language to younger generations, as the researchers predict.\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that Anishinaabe adults who didn’t attend the school feel approximately the same degree of cultural pride as those adults who did attend wouldn’t support the researchers’ prediction that former students will be more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations. This finding would identify a similarity between the groups rather than a factor that might make former students more likely than other adults to transmit the language to younger people. Choice B is incorrect because finding that new students experience increased performance in language fluency and academics would suggest that the school has a positive effect on students when they attended but wouldn’t reveal anything about those students’ later actions as adults (such as their likelihood of sharing their knowledge with younger generations). Choice C is incorrect because finding that Anishinaabe adults who attended the school are equally likely to stay in the community as adults who didn’t attend the school wouldn’t support the researchers’ prediction that former students will be more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations. This finding would identify a similarity between the groups rather than a factor that might make former students more likely than other adults to transmit the language to younger people.",

D Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers’ prediction about the language nest model of education. The text states that Morcom and Roy studied the effects of the language nest model of education on students at an Anishinaabe school, and they found that the model—which is used with students during pre-K or elementary school—increased students’ fluency in the Anishinaabe language and pride in Anishinaabe culture. The researchers predicted that the students’ positive early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them to be more likely to later share the language with younger generations. If former students maintain full fluency and cultural pride after finishing secondary and higher education, it follows that they would be both able and motivated to share what they know with others; this would likely result in a higher probability of transmitting the language to younger generations, as the researchers predict.\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that Anishinaabe adults who didn’t attend the school feel approximately the same degree of cultural pride as those adults who did attend wouldn’t support the researchers’ prediction that former students will be more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations. This finding would identify a similarity between the groups rather than a factor that might make former students more likely than other adults to transmit the language to younger people. Choice B is incorrect because finding that new students experience increased performance in language fluency and academics would suggest that the school has a positive effect on students when they attended but wouldn’t reveal anything about those students’ later actions as adults (such as their likelihood of sharing their knowledge with younger generations). Choice C is incorrect because finding that Anishinaabe adults who attended the school are equally likely to stay in the community as adults who didn’t attend the school wouldn’t support the researchers’ prediction that former students will be more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations.

The text introduces the concern that pteropods are thought to be particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, or lower pH levels, due to the susceptibility of their calcium carbonate shells to dissolution at lower pH levels. However, the text then describes findings from a recent study that suggest this concern may be unjustified, insofar as the protective periostracum coating on a pteropod’s shell prevents dissolution, and even when the coating is breached, a pteropod can rebuild the inner shell wall, reducing the damage.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t call for additional research or suggest that more research is needed on biological mechanisms that improve pteropod survival rates. Instead, the text discusses a recent study showing that pteropods may not be as vulnerable to ocean acidification as is feared. Choice B is incorrect because the study discussed in the text doesn’t address calcium carbonate’s role in protecting the periostracum of pteropods. According to the text, the study addresses the periostracum’s role in protecting pteropods’ calcium carbonate shells from dissolution due to ocean acidification. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t address how ocean acidification has altered pteropod behavior over time. Instead, the text focuses on the potential effects of ocean acidification on pteropods’ shells and the mechanisms protecting against those effects.",

Near Vancouver Island in Canada, the otter population is large and well established, yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those found elsewhere off Canada’s coast.

Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant’s rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadows’ health overall.",

    "D": "At some sites in the study, the health of plants unrelated to eelgrass correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations.",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken Foster’s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots improves the health of eelgrass meadows by boosting genetic diversity. The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there’s a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don’t have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn’t leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster’s hypothesis.\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn’t weaken Foster’s hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn’t be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn’t undermine Foster’s hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster’s hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows. Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn’t reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows. Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster’s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots.",

Jetties can sometimes have the opposite ______ blank obstructing the natural flow of sand along the shore can lead to increased erosion in some areas.   effect , though ; effect , though effect ; though effect , though , A Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma to separate the supplementary adverb \"though\" from the preceding main clause (\"Jetties can sometimes have the opposite effect\") and uses a semicolon to join the next main clause (\"obstructing…areas\") to the rest of the sentence. Further, placing the semicolon after \"though\" logically indicates that the information earlier in this sentence (that jetties can sometimes cause erosion) is contrary to what might be assumed from the information in the previous sentence (that jetties are often constructed for the purpose of protecting coastlines from erosion).\nChoice B is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the two main clauses with appropriate punctuation. With \"though…areas\" functioning as a subordinate clause following the comma, this choice illogically indicates that the following information (that obstructing the natural flow of sand along the shore can sometimes lead to erosion) is contrary to the information earlier in the sentence (that jetties can sometimes cause erosion). Instead, the information following \"though\" supports the previous claim about the erosive effects of jetties. Choice C is incorrect because it’s not conventional to use a semicolon in this way to separate a main clause from a dependent clause. Further, it illogically indicates that the following information (that obstructing the natural flow of sand along the shore can sometimes lead to erosion) is contrary to the information earlier in the sentence (that jetties can sometimes cause erosion). Instead, the information following \"though\" supports the previous claim about the erosive effects of jetties. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a comma splice.

    "Figure": "The graphic is a line graph titled “Monthly Hours of Sunshine from April to September in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska,” shown in two centered lines at the top. The horizontal axis is labeled “Month” centered below the plot. The horizontal axis categories are the month names April, May, June, July, August, and September, each printed below the axis and rotated about 40 degrees counterclockwise. Thin vertical reference lines run through the plotting area at each month position. The vertical axis on the left is labeled “Hours of sunshine” (rotated vertically). It ranges from 0 to 350 with labeled ticks every 50 (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350). For each labeled value, there is a thin horizontal grid line extending across the plotting area and a short tick mark intersecting the left axis. The bottom grid line corresponds to 0, and the top grid line corresponds to 350.\n\nA legend enclosed in a thin rectangular box appears below the chart. It shows two line styles: a solid black line with triangular arrowhead markers at its ends labeled “Anchorage,” and a black dashed line (dash pattern about 9 on, 6 off) with small gray square end markers outlined in black labeled “Fairbanks.” Both legend sample lines use the same styles as the plotted series.\n\nTwo series are plotted with straight segments connecting successive months. Anchorage is drawn as a solid black line with small black triangular markers at the ends of each segment; Fairbanks is drawn as a black dashed line with small gray square end markers. Both series use a relatively thick stroke (visibly heavier than the axes and grid lines).\n\nReading approximate values from the vertical axis:\n- Anchorage: April ≈ 254.0 hours, May ≈ 268.0, June ≈ 288.0, July ≈ 255.0, August ≈ 184.0, September ≈ 128.0.\n- Fairbanks: April ≈ 302.0 hours, May ≈ 319.0, June ≈ 334.0, July ≈ 274.0, August ≈ 164.0, September ≈ 122.0.\n\nAcross the months, both lines rise from April to June and then decline from June through September. Each series reaches its maximum in June (Anchorage about 288.0; Fairbanks about 334.0) and its minimum in September (Anchorage about 128.0; Fairbanks about 122.0). From April through July, the Fairbanks dashed line is above the Anchorage solid line, with differences of about 48.0 hours in April (302.0 vs 254.0), 51.0 in May (319.0 vs 268.0), 46.0 in June (334.0 vs 288.0), and 19.0 in July (274.0 vs 255.0). Between July and August the ordering reverses; the two lines cross once between those months, and in August and September the Anchorage solid line is higher by about 20.0 hours (184.0 vs 164.0) and 6.0 hours (128.0 vs 122.0), respectively. The largest month-to-month drop occurs on the Fairbanks series between June and August (down about 170.0 hours cumulatively), with a particularly steep decline of about 110.0 hours from July to August.

    "Question Text": "Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the student’s conclusion?",
    "A": "The monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks hold steady in June and July before beginning to decline in August.",
    "B": "The monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks increase from April to June and then decrease from June to September.",
    "C": "Anchorage and Fairbanks both have less than 200 monthly hours of sunshine from April to September.",
    "D": "Anchorage and Fairbanks both have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June and less than 200 hours from July to September.",
    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the student’s conclusion about weather patterns in Anchorage and Fairbanks. According to the graph, the amount of sunshine increases in both cities from April to June: in Anchorage, the number of monthly hours increases from about 250 to just under 300, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours increases from about 300 to just under 350. Also according to the graph, the amount of sunshine decreases in both cities from June to September: in Anchorage the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 300 to about 125, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 350 to about 125. Thus, the monthly hours of sunshine in both cities follow a similar pattern, increasing from April to June and then decreasing from June to September.\nChoice A is incorrect because, according to the graph, the monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks decrease from June to July. They don’t hold steady. In June there are slightly less than 300 hours of sunshine in Anchorage and slightly less than 350 hours in Fairbanks. Then, in July there are approximately 250 hours of sunshine in both cities. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that Anchorage and Fairbanks have less than 200 monthly hours of sunshine only in August and September. For the rest of the months represented in the graph, both cities have more than 200 monthly hours of sunshine. Choice D is incorrect because, according to the graph, Anchorage doesn’t have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June. In addition, both cities have more than 200 hours of sunshine in July, although the amount of sunshine does decrease to less than 200 monthly hours in August and September.",

Thin vertical reference lines run through the plotting area at each month position. The vertical axis on the left is labeled “Hours of sunshine” (rotated vertically). It ranges from 0 to 350 with labeled ticks every 50 (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350). For each labeled value, there is a thin horizontal grid line extending across the plotting area and a short tick mark intersecting the left axis. The bottom grid line corresponds to 0, and the top grid line corresponds to 350.\n\nA legend enclosed in a thin rectangular box appears below the chart. It shows two line styles: a solid black line with triangular arrowhead markers at its ends labeled “Anchorage,” and a black dashed line (dash pattern about 9 on, 6 off) with small gray square end markers outlined in black labeled “Fairbanks.” Both legend sample lines use the same styles as the plotted series.\n\nTwo series are plotted with straight segments connecting successive months. Anchorage is drawn as a solid black line with small black triangular markers at the ends of each segment; Fairbanks is drawn as a black dashed line with small gray square end markers. Both series use a relatively thick stroke (visibly heavier than the axes and grid lines).\n\nReading approximate values from the vertical axis:\n- Anchorage: April ≈ 254.0 hours, May ≈ 268.0, June ≈ 288.0, July ≈ 255.0, August ≈ 184.0, September ≈ 128.0.\n- Fairbanks: April ≈ 302.0 hours, May ≈ 319.0, June ≈ 334.0, July ≈ 274.0, August ≈ 164.0, September ≈ 122.0.\n\nAcross the months, both lines rise from April to June and then decline from June through September. Each series reaches its maximum in June (Anchorage about 288.0; Fairbanks about 334.0) and its minimum in September (Anchorage about 128.0; Fairbanks about 122.0). From April through July, the Fairbanks dashed line is above the Anchorage solid line, with differences of about 48.0 hours in April (302.0 vs 254.0), 51.0 in May (319.0 vs 268.0), 46.0 in June (334.0 vs 288.0), and 19.0 in July (274.0 vs 255.0). Between July and August the ordering reverses; the two lines cross once between those months, and in August and September the Anchorage solid line is higher by about 20.0 hours (184.0 vs 164.0) and 6.0 hours (128.0 vs 122.0), respectively. The largest month-to-month drop occurs on the Fairbanks series between June and August (down about 170.0 hours cumulatively), with a particularly steep decline of about 110.0 hours from July to August. No shaded regions or additional annotations are present. Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the student’s conclusion? The monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks hold steady in June and July before beginning to decline in August. The monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks increase from April to June and then decrease from June to September. Anchorage and Fairbanks both have less than 200 monthly hours of sunshine from April to September. Anchorage and Fairbanks both have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June and less than 200 hours from July to September. B Choice B is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the student’s conclusion about weather patterns in Anchorage and Fairbanks. According to the graph, the amount of sunshine increases in both cities from April to June: in Anchorage, the number of monthly hours increases from about 250 to just under 300, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours increases from about 300 to just under 350. Also according to the graph, the amount of sunshine decreases in both cities from June to September: in Anchorage the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 300 to about 125, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 350 to about 125. Thus, the monthly hours of sunshine in both cities follow a similar pattern, increasing from April to June and then decreasing from June to September.\nChoice A is incorrect because, according to the graph, the monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks decrease from June to July. They don’t hold steady. In June there are slightly less than 300 hours of sunshine in Anchorage and slightly less than 350 hours in Fairbanks. Then, in July there are approximately 250 hours of sunshine in both cities. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that Anchorage and Fairbanks have less than 200 monthly hours of sunshine only in August and September. For the rest of the months represented in the graph, both cities have more than 200 monthly hours of sunshine. Choice D is incorrect because, according to the graph, Anchorage doesn’t have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June. In addition, both cities have more than 200 hours of sunshine in July, although the amount of sunshine does decrease to less than 200 monthly hours in August and September.",

[Coketown] contained several large streets all very like one another, and many small streets still more like one another, inhabited by people equally like one another, who all went in and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same pavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next.",

    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The author describes Coketown as having streets that are all very similar and residents who live similarly and do the same work. This repetition of similarities emphasizes how everything in Coketown is alike.\nChoice B is incorrect. While the text mentions that all the residents “do the same work,” it never explains what that work is or why everyone does it. Besides, the idea that they all do the same work is just one of several similarities among the townspeople described in the text. Choice C is incorrect. While the last sentence states that “every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next,” it never suggests that people actually “lose track of time.” This is also too narrow to be the main idea, since time is just one of many aspects of Coketown that the text describes as always being the same. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions whether life is simple in Coketown, and the town sounds as though it’s probably a pretty dull place to live, rather than a pleasant one.",

While the last sentence states that “every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next,” it never suggests that people actually “lose track of time.” This is also too narrow to be the main idea, since time is just one of many aspects of Coketown that the text describes as always being the same. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions whether life is simple in Coketown, and the town sounds as though it’s probably a pretty dull place to live, rather than a pleasant one.",

    "Prompt": "Rivers rich in sediment appear yellow, while increases in red algae make rivers appear red. To track things like the sediment or algae content of large US rivers, John R. Gardner and colleagues used satellite data to determine the dominant visible wavelengths of light measured for various segments of these rivers. The researchers classified wavelengths of 495 nanometers (nm) and below as red, wavelengths between 495 and 560 nm as blue, and wavelengths of 560 nm and above as yellow. The researchers concluded that for the Missouri River, segments flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than those flowing out of lakes.",
    "Question Text": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ conclusion?",
    "A": "The segments of the Missouri River that had higher levels of chlorophyll-a, which contributes to the green color of photosynthetic organisms, have dominant wavelengths of light between 490 and 560 nm.",
    "B": "In lakes through which segments of the Missouri River pass, the dominant wavelength of light tended to be above 560 nm near the lakes’ shores and below 560 nm in the lakes’ centers.",
    "C": "The majority of the segments of the Missouri River were found to have dominant wavelengths of light significantly higher than 560 nm.",
    "D": "Segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes typically had dominant wavelengths of light above 560 nm, while segments flowing out of lakes typically had dominant wavelengths below 560 nm.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion that segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than do segments of the river flowing out of lakes. The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments flowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments flowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it flows into lakes than when it flows out of lakes.\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers’ conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river flowing out of lakes. This finding would not indicate anything about segments flowing into or out of lakes. Choice B is incorrect because finding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers’ conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes have more sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. This finding would suggest only that there is more sediment around the edges of lakes than in their centers, which does not have any direct bearing on the researchers’ conclusion about river segments flowing into and out of lakes. Choice C is incorrect because finding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths significantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments flowing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. Only a comparison of river segments flowing into lakes with segments flowing out of lakes can support the researchers’ conclusion.",

D Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion that segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than do segments of the river flowing out of lakes. The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above.

This finding would not indicate anything about segments flowing into or out of lakes. Choice B is incorrect because finding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers’ conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes have more sediment than segments flowing out of lakes.

We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our powers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be trusted, I think, in choosing some play most perfectly unexceptionable; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    "A": "To offer Tom’s assurance that the play will be inoffensive and involve only a small number of people",

At the beginning of the text, Tom asserts that he and the other people staging the play are doing so only for “a little amusement among ourselves” and aren’t interested in attracting an audience or any attention with the production. Then, Tom promises that the play they chose is modest and appropriate, and he further reasons that using the well-written prose of “some respectable author” is better than using their own words. Overall, the main purpose of the text is to convey Tom’s promise that the play will be inoffensive and involve only a few people.\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Tom had earlier intentions for the play’s performance or that anything has changed since the group first decided to stage a play. Instead, the text focuses on how harmless the entire endeavor will be. Choice C is incorrect. Although Tom mentions that using the words of a “respectable author” will be better than using their own words, he never addresses the idea that the people around him generally aren’t skilled enough to stage a play. Choice D is incorrect because in the text Tom specifically says that they “want no audience, no publicity,” which indicates that they don’t plan on promoting the play at all.",

Although the text discusses carbon dating as an archaeological method, it doesn’t compare it to any other alternative methods. Choice C is incorrect. The study doesn’t resolve any contradictions—rather, it introduces a contradiction to the one view presented at the beginning of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text never identifies any gaps in scientific research.",

    "Prompt": "Text 1 In 2007, a team led by Alice Storey analyzed a chicken bone found in El Arenal, Chile, dating it to 1321–1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region, bringing their own chickens. Storey also found that the El Arenal chicken shared a unique genetic mutation with the ancient chicken breeds of the Polynesian Islands in the Pacific. Thus, Polynesian peoples, not later Europeans, probably first introduced chickens to South America. Text 2 An Australian research team weakened the case for a Polynesian origin for the El Arenal chicken by confirming that the mutation identified by Storey has occurred in breeds from around the world. More recently, though, a team led by Agusto Luzuriaga-Neira found that South American chicken breeds and Polynesian breeds share other genetic markers that European breeds lack. Thus, the preponderance of evidence now favors a Polynesian origin.",
    "Question Text": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",
    "A": "By broadly agreeing with the claim but objecting that the timeline it presupposes conflicts with the findings of the genetic analysis conducted by Storey’s team",
    "B": "By faulting the claim for implying that domestic animals couldn’t have been transferred from South America to the Polynesian Islands as well",

    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say “[m]ore recently” Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but “that European breeds lack,” which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira’s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey’s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues’ evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey’s evidence is.\nChoice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from “1321–1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region” and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey’s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey’s conclusion) is deficient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens.",

Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from “1321–1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region” and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey’s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey’s conclusion) is deficient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens.",

Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say “[m]ore recently” Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but “that European breeds lack,” which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira’s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey’s evidence has been undermined.

Cosmochemist Kentaro Terada from Osaka University wondered if some of the unaccounted-for oxygen could be coming from Earth. In 2008, he analyzed data from the Japanese satellite Kaguya. Kaguya gathered data about gases and particles it encountered while orbiting the Moon. Based on the Kaguya data, Terada confirmed his suspicion that Earth is sending oxygen to the Moon.

One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses).

    "Figure": "The figure is a grouped bar chart titled “China’s Imports by Type, 2000–2006,” centered at the top. The horizontal axis is labeled “Import types” at the bottom center. Three import-type category labels—“ordinary imports,” “processing with assembly,” and “processing with inputs”—appear near their respective bar groups, set on a diagonal (rotated about 40 degrees). The vertical axis on the left is labeled vertically as “Imports (in hundreds of millions of dollars).” The vertical scale runs from 0 at the bottom to 3,500 at the top, with tick labels at 0, 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500, 3,000, and 3,500. At each of these values there is a horizontal grid line spanning the plotting area, and short tick marks align with the labels on the left. A solid vertical axis line runs up the left side of the plot area.\n\nData are shown as grouped vertical bars for each import type, with one bar for each of three years. Color encodes the year: dark gray (#666666) for 2000, light gray (#CCCCCC) for 2003, and black (#000000) for 2006. All bars have black outlines of uniform thickness. A legend below the chart sits within a thin black-outlined rectangle; it displays three small squares filled in dark gray, light gray, and black, labeled “2000,” “2003,” and “2006,” respectively.\n\nFor ordinary imports, the 2000 bar reaches 1,000.0 (hundreds of millions), the 2003 bar reaches 1,700.0, and the 2006 bar reaches 3,300.0. Within this category, values rise steadily: 2003 is 700.0 higher than 2000, and 2006 is 1,600.0 higher than 2003 (and 2,300.0 higher than 2000). For processing with assembly, the bars are much shorter: 2000 is 250.0, 2003 is 350.0, and 2006 is 750.0. Here, 2003 exceeds 2000 by 100.0, and 2006 exceeds 2003 by 400.0 (and exceeds 2000 by 500.0). For processing with inputs, the bars are intermediate in height: 2000 is 650.0, 2003 is 1,250.0, and 2006 is 2,300.0; increases are 600.0 from 2000 to 2003 and 1,050.0 from 2003 to 2006 (1,650.0 from 2000 to 2006).\n\nComparing categories within each year, ordinary imports are the tallest in all three years, followed by processing with inputs, then processing with assembly. In 2000, ordinary imports exceed processing with inputs by 350.0 and processing with assembly by 750.0; in 2003, ordinary imports exceed processing with inputs by 450.0 and processing with assembly by 1,350.0; in 2006, ordinary imports exceed processing with inputs by 1,000.0 and processing with assembly by 2,550.0. The highest bar overall is ordinary imports in 2006 at 3,300.0, and the lowest is processing with assembly in 2000 at 250.0. All three categories show increases from 2000 to 2003 to 2006.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the student’s assertion?",
    "A": "Processing imports with inputs were greater than both ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly in 2006.",
    "B": "From 2000 to 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply than processing imports with assembly did.",
    "C": "From 2000 to 2006, neither processing imports with inputs nor processing imports with assembly were greater than ordinary imports.",
    "D": "Processing imports with assembly were greater in 2006 than processing imports with inputs in 2000.",
    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that best support the student’s assertion that initial efforts at trade liberalization in China were shaped by firms having limited capital (assets available for use) and that this situation resolved during the 2000s. The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn’t require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China’s imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn’t, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms’ assets—and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports—were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006. In other words, the data suggest that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.\nChoice A is incorrect because the graph indicates that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2006, not that processing imports with inputs were greater than ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly that year. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2000, 2003, and 2006 doesn’t address a change within any type of imports from 2000 to 2006, and an indication of a change in that period that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that processing imports with assembly were greater at the end of the period from 2000 to 2006 than processing imports with inputs were at the start of the same period doesn’t address a change within either type of imports during the period, and an indication of such a change that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.",

One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses).

From 2000 to 2006, neither processing imports with inputs nor processing imports with assembly were greater than ordinary imports. Processing imports with assembly were greater in 2006 than processing imports with inputs in 2000. B Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that best support the student’s assertion that initial efforts at trade liberalization in China were shaped by firms having limited capital (assets available for use) and that this situation resolved during the 2000s. The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn’t require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China’s imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn’t, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms’ assets—and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports—were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006. In other words, the data suggest that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.\nChoice A is incorrect because the graph indicates that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2006, not that processing imports with inputs were greater than ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly that year. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2000, 2003, and 2006 doesn’t address a change within any type of imports from 2000 to 2006, and an indication of a change in that period that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that processing imports with assembly were greater at the end of the period from 2000 to 2006 than processing imports with inputs were at the start of the same period doesn’t address a change within either type of imports during the period, and an indication of such a change that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.",

Three import-type category labels—“ordinary imports,” “processing with assembly,” and “processing with inputs”—appear near their respective bar groups, set on a diagonal (rotated about 40 degrees). The vertical axis on the left is labeled vertically as “Imports (in hundreds of millions of dollars).” The vertical scale runs from 0 at the bottom to 3,500 at the top, with tick labels at 0, 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500, 3,000, and 3,500. At each of these values there is a horizontal grid line spanning the plotting area, and short tick marks align with the labels on the left. A solid vertical axis line runs up the left side of the plot area.\n\nData are shown as grouped vertical bars for each import type, with one bar for each of three years. Color encodes the year: dark gray (#666666) for 2000, light gray (#CCCCCC) for 2003, and black (#000000) for 2006. All bars have black outlines of uniform thickness. A legend below the chart sits within a thin black-outlined rectangle; it displays three small squares filled in dark gray, light gray, and black, labeled “2000,” “2003,” and “2006,” respectively.\n\nFor ordinary imports, the 2000 bar reaches 1,000.0 (hundreds of millions), the 2003 bar reaches 1,700.0, and the 2006 bar reaches 3,300.0. Within this category, values rise steadily: 2003 is 700.0 higher than 2000, and 2006 is 1,600.0 higher than 2003 (and 2,300.0 higher than 2000). For processing with assembly, the bars are much shorter: 2000 is 250.0, 2003 is 350.0, and 2006 is 750.0. Here, 2003 exceeds 2000 by 100.0, and 2006 exceeds 2003 by 400.0 (and exceeds 2000 by 500.0). For processing with inputs, the bars are intermediate in height: 2000 is 650.0, 2003 is 1,250.0, and 2006 is 2,300.0; increases are 600.0 from 2000 to 2003 and 1,050.0 from 2003 to 2006 (1,650.0 from 2000 to 2006).\n\nComparing categories within each year, ordinary imports are the tallest in all three years, followed by processing with inputs, then processing with assembly. In 2000, ordinary imports exceed processing with inputs by 350.0 and processing with assembly by 750.0; in 2003, ordinary imports exceed processing with inputs by 450.0 and processing with assembly by 1,350.0; in 2006, ordinary imports exceed processing with inputs by 1,000.0 and processing with assembly by 2,550.0. The highest bar overall is ordinary imports in 2006 at 3,300.0, and the lowest is processing with assembly in 2000 at 250.0. All three categories show increases from 2000 to 2003 to 2006. Processing imports with inputs were greater than both ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly in 2006. From 2000 to 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply than processing imports with assembly did. From 2000 to 2006, neither processing imports with inputs nor processing imports with assembly were greater than ordinary imports. Processing imports with assembly were greater in 2006 than processing imports with inputs in 2000.",

One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses).

From 2000 to 2006, neither processing imports with inputs nor processing imports with assembly were greater than ordinary imports. Processing imports with assembly were greater in 2006 than processing imports with inputs in 2000. B Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that best support the student’s assertion that initial efforts at trade liberalization in China were shaped by firms having limited capital (assets available for use) and that this situation resolved during the 2000s. The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn’t require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China’s imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn’t, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms’ assets—and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports—were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006. In other words, the data suggest that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.\nChoice A is incorrect because the graph indicates that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2006, not that processing imports with inputs were greater than ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly that year. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2000, 2003, and 2006 doesn’t address a change within any type of imports from 2000 to 2006, and an indication of a change in that period that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that processing imports with assembly were greater at the end of the period from 2000 to 2006 than processing imports with inputs were at the start of the same period doesn’t address a change within either type of imports during the period, and an indication of such a change that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.",

It exposed the unlivable wages and dangerous working conditions coal miners faced in Kentucky during the 1920s and 1930s. South African singer-songwriter Hugh Masekela released the protest song “Bring Him Back Home” in 1987. It called on the South African government to free Nelson Mandela, an anti-apartheid leader who’d been unjustly imprisoned.   The songs “Poor Miner’s Farewell” and “Bring Him Back Home” both raised awareness about human rights violations. While both are protest songs, “Poor Miner’s Farewell” is about coal miners in Kentucky, whereas “Bring Him Back Home” is about the anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela. Hugh Masekela’s song “Bring Him Back Home,” released in 1987, called on the South African government to free Nelson Mandela. Released in 1932 by Aunt Molly Jackson, the song “Poor Miner’s Farewell” was a protest against the unlivable wages and dangerous working conditions faced by Kentucky coal miners. B Choice B is the best answer. The sentence contrasts the two songs, noting that \"Poor Miner’s Farewell\" is about coal miners in Kentucky, whereas \"Bring Him Back Home\" is about Nelson Mandela.\nChoice A is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between \"Poor Miner’s Farewell\" and \"Bring Him Back Home\"; it doesn’t contrast the two songs. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence provides a description of the song \"Bring Him Back Home,\" it doesn’t mention \"Poor Miner’s Farewell\" or contrast the two songs. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence provides a description of the song \"Poor Miner’s Farewell,\" it doesn’t mention \"Bring Him Back Home\" or contrast the two songs.",

The text then indicates that the population size did indeed grow as a result of the planted trees. Thus, in this context, the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees was successful because it achieved the goal of increasing the bird’s population size.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers was \"amusing,\" or comical or entertaining. Instead, the approach was seriously undertaken and ultimately accomplished.

In this context, \"successful\" means accomplishing a goal or purpose. According to the text, conservationists planted more than 500,000 native trees in an Azores bullfinch habitat in order to boost the bird’s population size. The text then indicates that the population size did indeed grow as a result of the planted trees. Thus, in this context, the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees was successful because it achieved the goal of increasing the bird’s population size.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers was \"amusing,\" or comical or entertaining. Instead, the approach was seriously undertaken and ultimately accomplished. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address how much it cost to achieve the goal of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers. The text indicates that the approach was beneficial and successful rather than \"costly,\" or expensive or harmful. Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers was beneficial and successful rather than \"disastrous,\" or damaging or unsuccessful.",

    "Table": "The table is titled \"Housing Starts in the US, January–April 2022 (in thousands)\" and presents data on the number of housing starts in the United States for the first four months of 2022. The table consists of two columns and five rows, including the header row.\n\nThe first row serves as the header and contains two column headings: \"Month\" and \"Housing starts.\" The \"Month\" column is left-aligned, while the \"Housing starts\" column is center-aligned. The unit for the data is specified in the caption as \"in thousands,\" but this is not repeated in the column headers themselves.\n\nThe body of the table lists four months in chronological order: January, February, March, and April. Each month occupies its own row in the first column. The corresponding values in the second column represent the number of housing starts, given as follows:\n- January: 1,669\n- February: 1,771\n- March: 1,713\n- April: 1,803\n\nAll numerical values are center-aligned within their cells. There are no missing values, symbols, or footnotes present in the table. The data shows that the number of housing starts increased from January to February (an increase of 102), then decreased slightly in March (a decrease of 58 from February), and increased again in April to the highest value in the table (an increase of 90 from March).

The text discusses Fiorelli and colleagues’ discovery of egg clutches, single eggs, and eggshells in a Brazilian mine.

The text then explains that the finding is important because of the “previous lack of known nesting sites in northern regions of South America.” If there haven’t been any other discoveries of a nesting site in South America’s northern regions and the site in the Brazilian mine is the first, then the text strongly suggests that the site is farther north than other nesting sites that have been discovered in South America.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the site discovered by Fiorelli and colleagues is the earliest titanosaur nesting and breeding site known to paleontologists but rather that it’s the first nesting site found in northern regions of South America. Moreover, the text doesn’t suggest how the timeline of the newly discovered site compares with that of other titanosaur nesting and breeding sites. Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention in the text about any difficulties that Fiorelli and colleagues faced when they were excavating the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the idea that the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine was occupied by sauropods other than titanosaurs.

According to the text, the presence of these eggs, which are from the Late Cretaceous period, led the researchers to conclude that the location was once a nesting and breeding site for titanosaurs. The text then explains that the finding is important because of the “previous lack of known nesting sites in northern regions of South America.” If there haven’t been any other discoveries of a nesting site in South America’s northern regions and the site in the Brazilian mine is the first, then the text strongly suggests that the site is farther north than other nesting sites that have been discovered in South America.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the site discovered by Fiorelli and colleagues is the earliest titanosaur nesting and breeding site known to paleontologists but rather that it’s the first nesting site found in northern regions of South America. Moreover, the text doesn’t suggest how the timeline of the newly discovered site compares with that of other titanosaur nesting and breeding sites. Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention in the text about any difficulties that Fiorelli and colleagues faced when they were excavating the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the idea that the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine was occupied by sauropods other than titanosaurs. The text simply mentions that titanosaurs are sauropod dinosaurs and presents the researchers’ conclusion that the site they discovered was for titanosaurs.",

    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sediments found at the Gale Crater’s Murray Formation on Mars. The text states that data gathered by the Curiosity rover suggest that bodies of water deposited sediment on Mars’s surface long ago. The text goes on to say that studying the sediment, Rivera-Hernández et al. found some coarse grains they believe are sandstone, which tends to be left by flowing water, and many more fine grains they believe are mudstone, which tends to slowly sink in low-flow water. The text further indicates that the researchers noted cracks in the fine grains that suggest there were cycles of desiccation, or drying, at the site. Taken together, this information suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) existed at the site for a prolonged period but occasionally experienced drying and that there were periods in which one or more streams (flowing water) were present, since the extended existence of a lake would account for the abundance of fine grains, periods of drying would account for the cracks in the fine grains, and periods with streams would account for the sections of coarse grains.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that an abundance of fine grains of sediment was found at the Murray Formation site, which suggests that a low-flow water source (such as a lake) was present. Further, the text makes no mention of where the water at the site may have originated from. Choice C is incorrect because the evidence described in the text doesn’t support the idea that there were streams at the Murray Formation for an extended period and a lake for just a short time. The abundance of fine grains suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) was present for an extended time, not just a short time, and the sections of coarse grains suggest that one or more streams (bodies of flowing water) were intermittently present while the lake existed, not at a separate time. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that both a low-flow body of water (such as a lake) and flowing water (such as streams) existed at the Murray Formation site, meaning that there could have been a stream-fed lake, the text explains that the fine grains that signify the presence of a lake exhibit cracking that indicates periods of desiccation, or drying, which suggests that a lake was present but did occasionally dry out.",

    "Question Text": "Which choice best describes data in the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion?",
    "A": "In every year of the experiment, plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer had a yield of at least 30 pounds per acre.",
    "B": "In every year of the experiment, plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer had a greater yield than did plants treated with the control fertilizer.",
    "C": "The 2018 yield for plants treated with the control fertilizer was greater than was the 2019 yield for plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer.",
    "D": "The yield for plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer increased from 2017 to 2018.",
    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe production. The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017–2019). For each year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group. In pounds per acre, the value in 2017 for the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 30 while the control-group yield is less than 25; in 2018 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 40 while the control-group yield is less than 35; and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 25 while the control-group yield is less than 20. Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield.\nChoice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes data in the bar graph—in 2018, the control-group yield is greater than 30 pounds per acre, and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is less than 30 pounds per acre—a claim that the control-group yield exceeds that of the nitrogen group strongly conflicts with the researchers’ conclusion that nitrogen fertilizer produces larger yields. Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.",

B Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe production. The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017–2019).

Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield.\nChoice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre.

Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.",

The yield for plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer increased from 2017 to 2018. B Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe production. The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017–2019). For each year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group. In pounds per acre, the value in 2017 for the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 30 while the control-group yield is less than 25; in 2018 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 40 while the control-group yield is less than 35; and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 25 while the control-group yield is less than 20. Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield.\nChoice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre.

Although this choice accurately describes data in the bar graph—in 2018, the control-group yield is greater than 30 pounds per acre, and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is less than 30 pounds per acre—a claim that the control-group yield exceeds that of the nitrogen group strongly conflicts with the researchers’ conclusion that nitrogen fertilizer produces larger yields. Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.",

Which quotation from a literary critic best supports the student’s claim? “For one novel, an imagined account of a real person’s global travels, Tobar approached his subject like a reporter, interviewing people the man had met along the way and researching the man’s own writings.” “Tobar got his start as a volunteer for El Tecolote , a community newspaper in San Francisco, and wrote for newspapers for years before earning a degree in creative writing and starting to publish works of fiction.” “Many of Tobar’s notable nonfiction articles are marked by the writer’s use of techniques usually associated with fiction, such as complex narrative structures and the incorporation of symbolism.” “The protagonist of Tobar’s third novel is a man who wants to be a novelist and keeps notes about interesting people he encounters so he can use them when developing characters for his stories.” A Choice A is the best answer. The example of Tobar approaching his subject “like a reporter,” including conducting “interviews” and “research,” shows Tobar applying journalism techniques to his fiction-writing.\nChoice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. It tells us about Tobar’s initial career as a journalist, but it doesn’t say anything about him “applying journalism techniques” to his fiction-writing. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim.

    "A": "Harsh",
    "B": "Scratchy",
    "C": "Basic",
    "D": "Vague",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"rough\" most nearly means harsh, or forceful and unpleasant. The text describes Mary’s surroundings as she plays: the sun is out and there’s \"a little wind.\" To further illustrate the wind, the narrator contrasts the word \"rough\" with a description of the wind blowing in \"delightful little gusts,\" suggesting that the wind is not unpleasant or harsh at all.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"rough\" objects, or objects with irregular surfaces, can sometimes be scratchy, rough doesn’t mean scratchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not rough but rather gentle, \"delightful little gusts,\" which suggests that the use of \"rough\" here is referring to the degree of force of the wind. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wind wasn’t \"basic,\" or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as blowing not roughly or harshly but in \"delightful little gusts.\" Choice D is incorrect because the word \"vague\" means not clearly expressed or seen. Nothing in the text indicates that the wind was barely noticeable to Mary as she played outside, but rather the text states that it was delightful.",

    "text_prompt_table_figure_qtext_options_answer_rationale": "The following text is from Frances Hodgson Burnett’s 1911 novel The Secret Garden . Mary, a young girl, is outside trying her new jump rope. The sun was shining and a little wind was blowing—not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and up one walk and down another. As used in the text, what does the word “rough” most nearly mean? Harsh Scratchy Basic Vague A Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"rough\" most nearly means harsh, or forceful and unpleasant. The text describes Mary’s surroundings as she plays: the sun is out and there’s \"a little wind.\" To further illustrate the wind, the narrator contrasts the word \"rough\" with a description of the wind blowing in \"delightful little gusts,\" suggesting that the wind is not unpleasant or harsh at all.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"rough\" objects, or objects with irregular surfaces, can sometimes be scratchy, rough doesn’t mean scratchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not rough but rather gentle, \"delightful little gusts,\" which suggests that the use of \"rough\" here is referring to the degree of force of the wind. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wind wasn’t \"basic,\" or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as blowing not roughly or harshly but in \"delightful little gusts.\" Choice D is incorrect because the word \"vague\" means not clearly expressed or seen. Nothing in the text indicates that the wind was barely noticeable to Mary as she played outside, but rather the text states that it was delightful.",

The text doesn’t discuss the popularity of Rainey’s and Smith’s songs either in the 1920s or after. Although it is plausible that the music of Rainey and Smith is more widely enjoyed than it was in the 1920s, this isn’t supported by the text. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss which of Rainey and Smith was the more prolific recording artist and so provides no support for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect.

In this choice, a colon is correctly used to mark the boundary between one main clause (\"goats are notoriously indiscriminate\") and another main clause (\"they will devour all kinds of shrubs and weeds\") and to introduce the following explanation of goats’ nondiscriminatory behavior when it comes to what they eat.\nChoice A is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’s conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction. Furthermore, the conjunction \"and\" fails to indicate that what follows is an explanation of goats’ nondiscriminatory behavior when it comes to their diets. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to join two main clauses (\"goats…indiscriminate\" and \"they…weeds\"). Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses (\"goats…indiscriminate\" and \"they…weeds\") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.",

    "D": "Approximately 100 percent of Kenya’s population speaks Swahili, while only about 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s population speaks Swahili.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the underlined claim. The text indicates that Swahili is the first language of up to 15 million people worldwide. The text goes on to claim, in the underlined portion, that even in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili, many of the language’s speakers don’t have Swahili as their first language. The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their first language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their first language. This information about Swahili speakers in Tanzania therefore supports the claim that many Swahili speakers in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili speak it as a language other than their first language (such as their second, third, or fourth language).\nChoice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe information in the table. According to the table, Tanzania has 61 million Swahili speakers, not at most 15 million Swahili speakers. Additionally, the table indicates that 100 percent of Tanzania’s population speak Swahili, which means that the number of Swahili speakers in the country and the country’s total population should be the same, not that they should differ by such a large amount. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the table or the text that indicates where people who speak Swahili as their first language live. Although Kenya’s total population can be inferred from the table—if Kenya has 55 million Swahili speakers and 100% of Kenya’s population speak Swahili, then Kenya must have a population of 55 million people—nothing suggests that all the people who speak Swahili as their first language live in a single country, let alone that they all live in Kenya. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that 100 percent of Kenya’s population and 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s population speak Swahili, this comparison is irrelevant to the claim that Swahili isn’t the first language of many of its speakers even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili. On its own, a difference in the proportions of the population who speak Swahili cannot reveal whether those Swahili speakers have Swahili as their first language or a subsequent language.",

Although Kenya’s total population can be inferred from the table—if Kenya has 55 million Swahili speakers and 100% of Kenya’s population speak Swahili, then Kenya must have a population of 55 million people—nothing suggests that all the people who speak Swahili as their first language live in a single country, let alone that they all live in Kenya. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that 100 percent of Kenya’s population and 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s population speak Swahili, this comparison is irrelevant to the claim that Swahili isn’t the first language of many of its speakers even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili. On its own, a difference in the proportions of the population who speak Swahili cannot reveal whether those Swahili speakers have Swahili as their first language or a subsequent language.",

Approximately 100 percent of Kenya’s population speaks Swahili, while only about 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s population speaks Swahili. A Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the underlined claim. The text indicates that Swahili is the first language of up to 15 million people worldwide. The text goes on to claim, in the underlined portion, that even in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili, many of the language’s speakers don’t have Swahili as their first language. The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their first language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their first language. This information about Swahili speakers in Tanzania therefore supports the claim that many Swahili speakers in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili speak it as a language other than their first language (such as their second, third, or fourth language).\nChoice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe information in the table. According to the table, Tanzania has 61 million Swahili speakers, not at most 15 million Swahili speakers. Additionally, the table indicates that 100 percent of Tanzania’s population speak Swahili, which means that the number of Swahili speakers in the country and the country’s total population should be the same, not that they should differ by such a large amount. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the table or the text that indicates where people who speak Swahili as their first language live. Although Kenya’s total population can be inferred from the table—if Kenya has 55 million Swahili speakers and 100% of Kenya’s population speak Swahili, then Kenya must have a population of 55 million people—nothing suggests that all the people who speak Swahili as their first language live in a single country, let alone that they all live in Kenya. Choice D is incorrect.

    "Figure": "The figure is a vertical bar chart titled “Percentage of Nonhexagonal Cells in Hives of Three Honeybee Species,” shown on two centered title lines. The horizontal axis is labeled “Species” and lists three categories, each printed below the plot and angled up to the left at about 40 degrees: “black dwarf honeybee,” “dwarf honeybee,” and “western honeybee.” The vertical axis, drawn at the left, is labeled (rotated vertically) “Average percentage of nonhexagonal cells by shape.” Its numeric scale runs from 0 at the bottom to 3.0 at the top, with tick marks and grid lines every 0.5 unit at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0. Horizontal grid lines extend across the plotting area at each tick. Axis lines and grid lines are thin black strokes.\n\nEach species has three adjacent bars that encode the shapes of nonhexagonal cells, as clarified by a legend in a bordered box near the bottom of the figure. The legend shows three color swatches: a medium gray square labeled “5-sided cells,” a light gray square labeled “7-sided cells,” and a black square labeled “8-sided cells.” The bars match these fills and are outlined with thin black borders. Within each species group, the ordering left to right is medium gray (5-sided), light gray (7-sided), then black (8-sided).\n\nFor the black dwarf honeybee, the 5-sided (medium gray) bar reaches about 2.5, the 7-sided (light gray) bar reaches about 2.4, and the 8-sided (black) bar is at 0.0 (zero height). Thus, for this species the 5-sided value is higher than the 7-sided value by about 0.1 point, and both are about 2.4–2.5 points higher than the 8-sided value. For the dwarf honeybee, the 5-sided bar is highest at about 2.6, the 7-sided bar is about 2.1, and the 8-sided bar is about 0.2; here the 5-sided bar exceeds the 7-sided by about 0.5 point, and the 8-sided bar is 1.9 points below the 7-sided and 2.4 points below the 5-sided. For the western honeybee, the 5-sided bar is about 0.5, the 7-sided bar about 0.4, and the 8-sided bar about 0.1; the 5-sided value is 0.1 point above the 7-sided and 0.4 points above the 8-sided.\n\nComparing across species by shape: for 5-sided cells, dwarf honeybee (≈2.6) is slightly higher than black dwarf honeybee (≈2.5) by about 0.1 point, and both are much higher than western honeybee (≈0.5) by about 2.0–2.1 points. For 7-sided cells, black dwarf honeybee (≈2.4) is higher than dwarf honeybee (≈2.1) by about 0.3 point, and both exceed western honeybee (≈0.4) by about 1.7–2.0 points. For 8-sided cells, dwarf honeybee (≈0.2) is highest, western honeybee (≈0.1) is next, and black dwarf honeybee is at 0.0; the differences are small (about 0.1–0.2 point). No bar reaches the top of the scale (3.0). There are no trend lines, error bars, or shaded regions beyond the horizontal grid lines.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion?",
    "A": "cells for worker eggs are probably closer in size to cells for drone eggs in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.",
    "B": "both the western honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee probably reserve eight-sided cells for drone eggs, while the dwarf honeybee likely deposits drone eggs in seven-sided cells.",
    "C": "the western honeybee probably relies on many more geometrical shapes when constructing cells than either the dwarf honeybee or the black dwarf honeybee does.",
    "D": "the percentage of hexagonal cells is probably slightly lower in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion about beehive structure. The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species.\nChoice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on \"many more\" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a higher percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage.",

Difference in cell size results in a construction problem—it’s hard to neatly connect sections of small cells to sections of large cells—that worsens as the difference increases. To fill in gaps between the sections when building a hive, bees rely on cells that have more or fewer than six sides. A student studying beehive structure consults data on three species, concluding that ______ blank  The figure is a vertical bar chart titled “Percentage of Nonhexagonal Cells in Hives of Three Honeybee Species,” shown on two centered title lines. The horizontal axis is labeled “Species” and lists three categories, each printed below the plot and angled up to the left at about 40 degrees: “black dwarf honeybee,” “dwarf honeybee,” and “western honeybee.” The vertical axis, drawn at the left, is labeled (rotated vertically) “Average percentage of nonhexagonal cells by shape.” Its numeric scale runs from 0 at the bottom to 3.0 at the top, with tick marks and grid lines every 0.5 unit at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0. Horizontal grid lines extend across the plotting area at each tick. Axis lines and grid lines are thin black strokes.\n\nEach species has three adjacent bars that encode the shapes of nonhexagonal cells, as clarified by a legend in a bordered box near the bottom of the figure. The legend shows three color swatches: a medium gray square labeled “5-sided cells,” a light gray square labeled “7-sided cells,” and a black square labeled “8-sided cells.” The bars match these fills and are outlined with thin black borders. Within each species group, the ordering left to right is medium gray (5-sided), light gray (7-sided), then black (8-sided).\n\nFor the black dwarf honeybee, the 5-sided (medium gray) bar reaches about 2.5, the 7-sided (light gray) bar reaches about 2.4, and the 8-sided (black) bar is at 0.0 (zero height). Thus, for this species the 5-sided value is higher than the 7-sided value by about 0.1 point, and both are about 2.4–2.5 points higher than the 8-sided value. For the dwarf honeybee, the 5-sided bar is highest at about 2.6, the 7-sided bar is about 2.1, and the 8-sided bar is about 0.2; here the 5-sided bar exceeds the 7-sided by about 0.5 point, and the 8-sided bar is 1.9 points below the 7-sided and 2.4 points below the 5-sided. For the western honeybee, the 5-sided bar is about 0.5, the 7-sided bar about 0.4, and the 8-sided bar about 0.1; the 5-sided value is 0.1 point above the 7-sided and 0.4 points above the 8-sided.\n\nComparing across species by shape: for 5-sided cells, dwarf honeybee (≈2.6) is slightly higher than black dwarf honeybee (≈2.5) by about 0.1 point, and both are much higher than western honeybee (≈0.5) by about 2.0–2.1 points. For 7-sided cells, black dwarf honeybee (≈2.4) is higher than dwarf honeybee (≈2.1) by about 0.3 point, and both exceed western honeybee (≈0.4) by about 1.7–2.0 points. For 8-sided cells, dwarf honeybee (≈0.2) is highest, western honeybee (≈0.1) is next, and black dwarf honeybee is at 0.0; the differences are small (about 0.1–0.2 point). No bar reaches the top of the scale (3.0). There are no trend lines, error bars, or shaded regions beyond the horizontal grid lines. Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion? cells for worker eggs are probably closer in size to cells for drone eggs in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee. both the western honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee probably reserve eight-sided cells for drone eggs, while the dwarf honeybee likely deposits drone eggs in seven-sided cells. the western honeybee probably relies on many more geometrical shapes when constructing cells than either the dwarf honeybee or the black dwarf honeybee does. the percentage of hexagonal cells is probably slightly lower in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion? cells for worker eggs are probably closer in size to cells for drone eggs in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee. both the western honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee probably reserve eight-sided cells for drone eggs, while the dwarf honeybee likely deposits drone eggs in seven-sided cells. the western honeybee probably relies on many more geometrical shapes when constructing cells than either the dwarf honeybee or the black dwarf honeybee does. the percentage of hexagonal cells is probably slightly lower in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee. A Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion about beehive structure. The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species.\nChoice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on \"many more\" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a higher percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage.",

For the western honeybee, the 5-sided bar is about 0.5, the 7-sided bar about 0.4, and the 8-sided bar about 0.1; the 5-sided value is 0.1 point above the 7-sided and 0.4 points above the 8-sided.\n\nComparing across species by shape: for 5-sided cells, dwarf honeybee (≈2.6) is slightly higher than black dwarf honeybee (≈2.5) by about 0.1 point, and both are much higher than western honeybee (≈0.5) by about 2.0–2.1 points. For 7-sided cells, black dwarf honeybee (≈2.4) is higher than dwarf honeybee (≈2.1) by about 0.3 point, and both exceed western honeybee (≈0.4) by about 1.7–2.0 points. For 8-sided cells, dwarf honeybee (≈0.2) is highest, western honeybee (≈0.1) is next, and black dwarf honeybee is at 0.0; the differences are small (about 0.1–0.2 point). No bar reaches the top of the scale (3.0). There are no trend lines, error bars, or shaded regions beyond the horizontal grid lines. cells for worker eggs are probably closer in size to cells for drone eggs in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee. both the western honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee probably reserve eight-sided cells for drone eggs, while the dwarf honeybee likely deposits drone eggs in seven-sided cells. the western honeybee probably relies on many more geometrical shapes when constructing cells than either the dwarf honeybee or the black dwarf honeybee does. the percentage of hexagonal cells is probably slightly lower in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee. A Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion about beehive structure. The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species.\nChoice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on \"many more\" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a higher percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage.",

The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of T. navigans , which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that T. navigans had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make T. navigans different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered flight, T. navigans likely flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.\nChoice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that T. navigans would have found \"sustained flight difficult,\" which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Therefore, Beccari’s team would not suggest that T. navigans flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari’s team would not suggest that T. navigans had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that T. navigans had a large-crested head. Therefore, Beccari’s team would not suggest that T. navigans had a smaller head than researchers previously expected.",

    "Figure": "The graphic is a line graph titled “Urban Population of Algeria, France, Japan, and Nigeria,” set in two centered title lines at the top. The horizontal axis is labeled “Year” beneath the plot. Year tick marks and vertical grid lines are shown every 10 years from 1970 to 2020, labeled 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020; the labels are rotated about 40 degrees clockwise and placed below the axis. The vertical axis is labeled in two stacked, rotated lines “Percent of population” and “living in cities.” Horizontal grid lines and left-axis tick labels are drawn every 10 percentage points from 0 to 100 (0 at the bottom up to 100 at the top). A vertical left-axis line runs from the top to the bottom of the plotting area. All grid and axis lines are thin black lines.\n\nA boxed legend sits below the plot area, roughly centered, containing four sample line segments with their styles and labels. The series encodings are:\n- Algeria: a solid black line (stroke width about 2.4) with small solid black triangular markers at segment ends.\n- France: a black dashed line (long dashes, dash pattern about 9 on/6 off, stroke width about 2.4) with gray square markers outlined in black at segment ends.\n- Japan: a black dotted line (very short dash pattern about 1.1 on/6 off with round caps, stroke width about 3) with white circular markers outlined in black at segment ends.\n- Nigeria: a thicker medium-gray line (#999, stroke width about 3.5) with small gray star-like markers outlined in black at segment ends.\n\nFour lines span 1970 to 2020, with one data point each decade. Reading values from the vertical axis (0–100%), the approximate percentages for each decade are as follows. In 1970: Japan about 76.9%, France about 71.1%, Algeria about 39.5%, and Nigeria about 17.8%. In 1980: Japan about 80.2%, France about 73.3%, Algeria about 43.5%, Nigeria about 22.0%. In 1990: Japan about 84.3%, France about 74.1%, Algeria about 52.1%, Nigeria about 29.7%. In 2000: Japan about 87.6%, France about 75.9%, Algeria about 59.9%, Nigeria about 34.8%. In 2010: Japan about 90.8%, France about 78.4%, Algeria about 67.5%, Nigeria about 43.5%. In 2020: Japan about 91.5%, France about 79.0%, Algeria about 73.7%, Nigeria about 52.0%. The plotted lines are smooth, monotonic decade-to-decade increases for all four series, with no reversals within the decades shown.\n\nAcross all years shown, Japan’s line is highest, followed by France, then Algeria, then Nigeria; there are no crossings. The gaps between series vary by decade. For example, in 1970 Japan is about 5.8 percentage points above France (76.9% vs. 71.1%); by 2020 that difference is about 12.5 points (91.5% vs. 79.0%). France exceeds Algeria by about 31.6 points in 1970 (71.1% vs. 39.5%) and by about 5.3 points in 2020 (79.0% vs. 73.7%). Algeria exceeds Nigeria by roughly 21.7 points in 1970 (39.5% vs. 17.8%) and also by about 21.7 points in 2020 (73.7% vs. 52.0%). Decade-to-decade increases are modest for France (roughly +0.6 to +2.5 points per decade) and Japan (roughly +0.7 to +4.1), and larger for Algeria and Nigeria at various intervals (Algeria grows by about +4.0 to +8.6 points per decade; Nigeria by about +4.2 to +8.7). There are no annotations, reference lines, or shaded regions beyond the grid.",

Reading values from the vertical axis (0–100%), the approximate percentages for each decade are as follows. In 1970: Japan about 76.9%, France about 71.1%, Algeria about 39.5%, and Nigeria about 17.8%. In 1980: Japan about 80.2%, France about 73.3%, Algeria about 43.5%, Nigeria about 22.0%. In 1990: Japan about 84.3%, France about 74.1%, Algeria about 52.1%, Nigeria about 29.7%. In 2000: Japan about 87.6%, France about 75.9%, Algeria about 59.9%, Nigeria about 34.8%.

The plotted lines are smooth, monotonic decade-to-decade increases for all four series, with no reversals within the decades shown.\n\nAcross all years shown, Japan’s line is highest, followed by France, then Algeria, then Nigeria; there are no crossings. The gaps between series vary by decade. For example, in 1970 Japan is about 5.8 percentage points above France (76.9% vs. 71.1%); by 2020 that difference is about 12.5 points (91.5% vs. 79.0%). France exceeds Algeria by about 31.6 points in 1970 (71.1% vs. 39.5%) and by about 5.3 points in 2020 (79.0% vs. 73.7%). Algeria exceeds Nigeria by roughly 21.7 points in 1970 (39.5% vs. 17.8%) and also by about 21.7 points in 2020 (73.7% vs. 52.0%). Decade-to-decade increases are modest for France (roughly +0.6 to +2.5 points per decade) and Japan (roughly +0.7 to +4.1), and larger for Algeria and Nigeria at various intervals (Algeria grows by about +4.0 to +8.6 points per decade; Nigeria by about +4.2 to +8.7).

The story of Hans Castorp that we intend to tell here—not for his sake (for the reader will come to know him as a perfectly ordinary, if engaging young man), but for the sake of the story itself, which seems to us to be very much worth telling (although in Hans Castorp’s favor it should be noted that it is his story, and that not every story happens to everybody)—is a story that took place long ago, and is, so to speak, covered with the patina of history and must necessarily be told with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past. © 1995 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.",
    "Question Text": "What does the text most strongly suggest about the story of Hans Castorp?",
    "A": "Though it is true that stories of even the most uninteresting people are themselves interesting because all people are unique, the reason this story is interesting is nonetheless difficult to understand because of the passage of time.",
    "B": "Even though it is a story of a person of no particular importance, its age and the manner in which it therefore must be told are both indicators that the story itself is important.",
    "C": "Like all stories about the lives of inconsequential people, this story must necessarily be related in a particular way if the reason the story is consequential is to be made evident to the audience.",
    "D": "It is a remarkable story that happened to an unremarkable person, though one could plausibly argue that because the story is valuable, some of its value accrues to the person at its center.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about Hans Castorp’s story that is suggested by the text. The narrator of the text indicates that the story about Hans Castorp will be told not because there is something particularly notable about him, since he is pleasant but \"perfectly ordinary,\" but because the story itself is remarkable (\"very much worth telling\"). The narrator then notes that there is a benefit in being at the heart of the story—that it is \"in Hans Castorp’s favor\" that the story is his, and maybe uniquely so (\"not every story happens to everybody\"). Thus, the text suggests both that the story that will be told is a remarkable one that happened to an unremarkable person and that it is reasonable to argue that the person at the center of a valuable story takes on some of the story’s value.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text makes the point that \"not every story happens to everybody,\" the narrator doesn’t state that stories are interesting simply because the people they are about are unique. Rather, the narrator suggests that one particular story is \"very much worth telling\" on its own and that Hans Castorp benefits from the fact that the story is remarkable and may be unique to him. Further, the narrator never suggests that the story will be hard to understand even though it is old. Choice B is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text suggests that Hans Castorp is of no particular importance, since he is a \"perfectly ordinary\" person, the narrator never reveals what makes the story of Castorp important, just that \"the story itself\" is \"very much worth telling.\" The narrator states that the story \"took place long ago,\" is \"covered with the patina of history,\" and can be told only \"with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past,\" but the story’s age and the way it must be told aren’t presented as reasons the story is important; the narrator is simply providing details about how the story will be told. Choice C is incorrect because the narrator of the text doesn’t suggest that all stories about people who are \"perfectly ordinary\" (like Hans Castorp) must be told in particular ways to make it clear why those stories are consequential. Further, the narrator suggests that Hans Castorp’s story must be told \"with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past\" because it took place so long ago, not because telling it that way will convey the story’s importance.",

It is a remarkable story that happened to an unremarkable person, though one could plausibly argue that because the story is valuable, some of its value accrues to the person at its center. D Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about Hans Castorp’s story that is suggested by the text. The narrator of the text indicates that the story about Hans Castorp will be told not because there is something particularly notable about him, since he is pleasant but \"perfectly ordinary,\" but because the story itself is remarkable (\"very much worth telling\"). The narrator then notes that there is a benefit in being at the heart of the story—that it is \"in Hans Castorp’s favor\" that the story is his, and maybe uniquely so (\"not every story happens to everybody\"). Thus, the text suggests both that the story that will be told is a remarkable one that happened to an unremarkable person and that it is reasonable to argue that the person at the center of a valuable story takes on some of the story’s value.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text makes the point that \"not every story happens to everybody,\" the narrator doesn’t state that stories are interesting simply because the people they are about are unique. Rather, the narrator suggests that one particular story is \"very much worth telling\" on its own and that Hans Castorp benefits from the fact that the story is remarkable and may be unique to him. Further, the narrator never suggests that the story will be hard to understand even though it is old. Choice B is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text suggests that Hans Castorp is of no particular importance, since he is a \"perfectly ordinary\" person, the narrator never reveals what makes the story of Castorp important, just that \"the story itself\" is \"very much worth telling.\" The narrator states that the story \"took place long ago,\" is \"covered with the patina of history,\" and can be told only \"with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past,\" but the story’s age and the way it must be told aren’t presented as reasons the story is important; the narrator is simply providing details about how the story will be told. Choice C is incorrect because the narrator of the text doesn’t suggest that all stories about people who are \"perfectly ordinary\" (like Hans Castorp) must be told in particular ways to make it clear why those stories are consequential. Further, the narrator suggests that Hans Castorp’s story must be told \"with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past\" because it took place so long ago, not because telling it that way will convey the story’s importance.",

The style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s films was therefore ______ blank   copied by many of Guy-Blaché’s peers. familiar to actors who had worked on other directors’ films. very unusual for the period. better than film acting today. C Choice C is the best answer. The text tells us that “actors tended to highly exaggerate their actions and expressions” in films produced from 1896 to 1920. This suggests that the natural style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s films was very unusual for the time.\nChoice A is incorrect. The text never discusses any other directors copying the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s films, and in fact suggests the opposite—that it was unusual for directors to suggest this style of acting at the time. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses actors’ familiarity with the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s films, so there isn’t much basis for this inference. But since the text tells us that other films of the period used a highly exaggerated form of acting, we might predict that the natural style in Guy-Blachés films would have been unfamiliar to these actors. Choice D is incorrect. The text never discusses film acting today, so there’s no basis for this inference.",

In other words, the narrator senses only a trace of soul left in the body.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “suggestion” can refer to an implied or indirectly expressed opinion, the text doesn’t portray the narrator expressing an opinion; instead, the narrator is explaining an experience of intense emotion. Choice C is incorrect. While “suggestion” might be used in some contexts to refer to the tactful expression of a differing viewpoint, it doesn’t refer to the dispute or difference of opinion itself. Moreover, the text doesn’t portray a dispute between characters with differing viewpoints. Choice D is incorrect.

The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed.\nChoice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is \"insensible to,\" or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris’s repudiation of industrialization.

Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris’s work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris’s attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is \"complicated by,\" or made more complex or difficult by, the Kelmscott Press’s use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books.

The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed.\nChoice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is \"insensible to,\" or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris’s repudiation of industrialization. Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense to say that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization was \"scrutinized by,\" or examined closely by, the Kelmscott editions’ use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation. Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris’s work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris’s attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is \"complicated by,\" or made more complex or difficult by, the Kelmscott Press’s use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books. Instead, the text presents those methods as exemplifying Morris’s repudiation of industrialization.",

    "Domain": "Information and Ideas",
    "Skill": "Command of Evidence",
    "Difficulty": "Hard",
    "Prompt": "Many archaeologists will tell you that categorizing excavated fragments of pottery by style, period, and what objects they belong to relies not only on standard criteria, but also on instinct developed over years of practice. In a recent study, however, researchers trained a deep-learning computer model on thousands of images of pottery fragments and found that it could categorize them as accurately as a team of expert archaeologists. Some archaeologists have expressed concern that they might be replaced by such computer models, but the researchers claim that outcome is highly unlikely.",
    "Question Text": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ claim?",
    "A": "In the researchers’ study, the model was able to categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could.",
    "B": "In the researchers’ study, neither the model nor the archeologists were able to accurately categorize all the pottery fragments that were presented.",
    "C": "A survey of archaeologists showed that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time they can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do.",
    "D": "A survey of archaeologists showed that few of them received dedicated training in how to properly categorize pottery fragments.",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text explains that although archaeologists hold that categorizing pottery fragments relies on both objective criteria and instinct developed through direct experience, researchers have found that a computer model can categorize the fragments with the same degree of accuracy as the humans can—a finding that has caused some archaeologists to worry that their own work won’t be needed any longer. If survey results indicate that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time archaeologists can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren’t able to do all of the important things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers’ claim that computer models are unlikely to replace human archaeologists.\nChoice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists’ work not only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace. Choice B is incorrect because the inability of both the computer model and the archaeologists to accurately categorize all of the pottery fragments presented wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text indicates that some archaeologists are worried because the computer model’s accuracy is equal to their own, and that could be the case whether both were perfectly accurate or were unable to achieve complete accuracy. Choice D is incorrect because survey results showing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The amount of special training in categorizing pottery fragments that archaeologists have received has no direct bearing on whether computer models’ success at categorizing fragments will lead to the models replacing the archaeologists.",
