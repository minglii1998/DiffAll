    "Prompt": "The following text is from William Shakespeare’s play The Tempest , first performed in 1611. Miranda has lived on an island with her father, Prospero, since she was three years old. Prospero has stated that Miranda likely does not remember anything other than her life on the island. MIRANDA: ’Tis far off, And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants. Had I not Four or five women once that tended me? PROSPERO: Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time? If thou remember’st ought ere thou camest here, How thou camest here thou mayst.",
    "Question Text": "In the text, which point does Prospero most directly make about Miranda and her memories?",
    "A": "Miranda’s reminiscences about her early childhood have a melancholy quality that betrays her discontented view of her current circumstances.",
    "B": "Miranda’s doubts about the accuracy of one recollection of a place other than the island are clouding her judgment and seem to be making her reluctant to explore her recollection of traveling to the island.",
    "C": "Miranda’s ability to summon details of an experience she had before arriving on the island suggests that she may also be able to summon details of her arrival on the island.",
    "D": "Miranda’s impression of a scene is vague because she is remembering a scenario she had daydreamed about as a child rather than a scenario that had occurred in reality.",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a point that Prospero makes about Miranda. The text begins with Miranda responding to Prospero’s claim that she probably doesn’t remember her life before the island. She describes a distant memory, asking if she had \"four or five women\" caring for her. Prospero confirms this (\"thou hadst\") and then asks what else she can recall, stating that because she remembers one thing from the time before she lived on the island (\"ought ere thou camest here\"), she might also remember arriving on the island (\"how thou camest here\"). That is, Prospero indicates that Miranda’s ability to summon details of an experience from before her arrival on the island suggests that she may also be able to summon details of her arrival.\nChoice A is incorrect because Prospero doesn’t say anything about how Miranda presents her early childhood memory of having several people care for her—he indicates only his surprise that she remembers something from so long ago (\"the dark backward and abysm of time\") and his thought that she may also be able to recall another childhood event: her arrival on the island. Further, Prospero doesn’t suggest that he believes Miranda is discontent in her current circumstances. Choice B is incorrect. Although Miranda suggests some doubt about her recollection of a place other than the island, in that she describes it as \"like a dream\" she can’t be certain of, Prospero doesn’t mention her uncertainty—though he himself wonders how it is possible that she correctly recalls something from so long ago (\"abysm of time\"). Rather than indicating that doubt is making Miranda reluctant, Prospero simply states that Miranda may have the ability to remember traveling to the island. Choice D is incorrect. Although Miranda describes a vague impression of several people who cared for her as a young child and states that it is \"rather like a dream\" instead of something she is certain is real, Prospero doesn’t indicate that Miranda is remembering a childhood daydream. Instead, he confirms that what Miranda remembers actually happened, answering her question about having had caregivers with \"thou hadst,\" and asks her what else she can remember from long ago.",

    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. This data shows that the tadpoles in the high-density pond (meaning those with the most competition) didn’t grow as big as the other two groups but produced more bufadienolide.\nChoice A is incorrect.

    "Prompt": "Historians Tiya Miles and Roy E. Finkenbine have both documented the assistance Indigenous peoples gave to Black freedom seekers leaving the South before the US Civil War. Much of the historical evidence of this help comes from Indigenous oral traditions and from autobiographies written by the freedom seekers. One such narrative is Jermain Loguen’s autobiography, which tells about how Neshnabé (Potawatomi) villagers offered him food, lodging, and directions during his 1835 journey from Tennessee to Canada.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence?",
    "A": "It provides an example of an autobiography that describes help given by an Indigenous people to a Black freedom seeker.",
    "B": "It shows why Loguen decided to write in great detail about his experiences traveling from Tennessee to Canada in his autobiography.",
    "C": "It argues that autobiographies are particularly important sources of information about geography in the United States before the Civil War.",
    "D": "It suggests that most historians believe that Neshnabé villagers were more successful in assisting freedom seekers than other people were.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The previous sentence broadly mentions \"autobiographies written by the freedom seekers.\" This sentence identifies Loguen’s autobiography as a specific example.\nChoice B is incorrect. The sentence never explains why Loguen chose to write about his experiences. Choice C is incorrect. The previous sentence identifies autobiographies as useful sources of historical information about a specific topic, but not for \"information about geography.\" The underlined sentence provides details of one autobiography as an example of a source of information about that specific topic (interactions between Indigenous people and Black freedom seekers).

    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of aptamers’ capacity to test for pathogens in food. The text explains that although synthetic aptamer molecules can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens because they bind to target molecules, it hasn’t been clear how likely it is that they will indicate a negative result when a target pathogen is absent in real-world foods. The text then indicates that Somvanshi et al. created test paper that changes from pink to purple when aptamers in it bind to a particular strain of E. coli bacteria, O157:H7, and tested it with store-bought pear juice (that is, a real-world food); the paper changed to purple when exposed to juice to which the target pathogen E. coli O157:H7 had been added, but it remained pink when exposed to juice treated with other E. coli strains or other bacteria species. Based on this result, it seems the aptamers in the paper successfully bound to the target (O157:H7) and the tests had a high degree of specificity (providing negative results for samples where the target was absent even though other bacteria were present) when applied to a real-world food.\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that E. coli O157:H7 differs from other pathogens in a way that makes it more suitable for aptamer-based testing of any kind and that specificity is likely to be lower when aptamer-based tests target other bacteria; the text simply indicates that Somvanshi et al. used O157:H7 as the target for aptamer-based test paper in their study and suggests that the paper had a high degree of specificity. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the specificity of aptamer-based tests in real-world foods is uncertain for pathogens broadly, not just for E. coli , and similarity between strains (of E. coli or of other pathogens) isn’t mentioned. Moreover, the results presented in the text suggest that aptamers are actually capable of distinguishing between strains of E. coli , since Somvanshi et al.’s paper turned purple when exposed to E. coli O157:H7 and remained pink when exposed to other strains. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the aptamers in the test papers didn’t bind to different strains of E. coli . The text explains that the test papers turn purple when the aptamers bind to the targeted pathogen and that in the pear juice tests, the test papers turned purple when exposed to samples with the targeted strain of E. coli (O157:H7) but remained pink when exposed to samples with other strains of E. coli . In other words, the aptamers bound only to the targeted strain, not to the other strains. Further, specificity would be affected if the aptamers had bound to multiple strains and not just the targeted one; that result would cause the specificity to be low.",

    "Prompt": "In Caddo, a language from what is now the US Southeast, vocabulary pertaining to corn cultivation resembles equivalent vocabulary in the Totozoquean language family in Mexico. This resemblance is perhaps attributable to cultural contact: such words could have entered Caddo through the intermediary of the neighboring but unrelated Chitimacha language, concurrent with the dissemination of corn itself from Mexico into the Southeast after 700 CE. That the vocabulary pertaining to domestic crops accompanies them as they diffuse into new regions is an established phenomenon globally. Crops may also be decoupled from vocabulary altogether: corn cultivation became ubiquitous among the Southeastern tribes, yet ______ blank",
    "Table": "The table is titled \"Corn-Related Vocabulary in Various Southeastern Languages\" and presents information in four columns and five rows (including the header row). The columns, from left to right, are labeled: \"Language family,\" \"Word (language),\" \"English translation,\" and \"Proposed origin in vocabulary of the Totozoquean language family.\" All column headers are centered both horizontally and vertically.\n\nThe first column, \"Language family,\" lists the language family for each entry. The second column, \"Word (language),\" provides the specific word for corn or a corn-related concept in the relevant language, along with the language in parentheses. The third column, \"English translation,\" gives the English meaning of the word. The fourth column, \"Proposed origin in vocabulary of the Totozoquean language family,\" indicates whether the word is proposed to have originated from the Totozoquean language family, with entries of either \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nThere are four data rows, each corresponding to a different language family:\n\n1. The first row is for the Muskogean family. The \"Word (language)\" cell lists three terms: \"tanchi’ (Chickasaw); tanchi (Choctaw); vce (Muscogee, pronounced 'uh-chi').\" The English translation is \"corn.\" The proposed Totozoquean origin is \"no.\"\n2. The second row is for the Iroquoian family. The word is \"se-lu (Cherokee),\" the English translation is \"corn,\" and the proposed origin is \"no.\"\n3. The third row is for the Caddoan family.

Two entries (Caddoan and Chitimacha) are marked \"yes\" for Totozoquean origin, while Muskogean and Iroquoian are marked \"no.\" The table includes some pronunciation guidance for the Muscogee word and distinguishes between \"corn\" and \"dried corn\" in the English translation column.

    "Question Text": "Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?",
    "A": "the origins of vocabulary pertaining to the crop vary across languages in the region, with the words for corn in Cherokee and the Muskogean languages showing no demonstrable relationship to Totozoquean vocabulary.",
    "B": "the region is linguistically diverse, being home not only to Chitimacha and Caddo, but also to the Muskogean language family (including Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Muscogee) and to one Iroquoian language (Cherokee).",
    "C": "corn-related vocabulary underwent changes when entering other, unrelated languages, as can be seen by the divergence of the Caddo word from the Chitimacha word it originated in.",
    "D": "words for corn in the languages of the Muskogean family evolved from a common root, with the Muscogee word having lost certain consonant sounds still present in the Chickasaw and Choctaw words.",

    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The table provides evidence that the words for corn in the Cherokee and Muskogean languages appear unrelated to those in Caddo language, which is described as closely related to the Totozoquean language family. This supports the claim that corn cultivation spread across the Southeast without necessarily spreading Totozoquean vocabulary along with it.\nChoice B is incorrect. This choice emphasizes the diversity of Southeastern languages in general, but we’re specifically looking for information about words associated with corn. Choice C is incorrect. This choice shows how words for corn can change and evolve, but we’re looking for an example that shows how some words for corn can be completely unrelated. Choice D is incorrect.

The fourth column, \"Proposed origin in vocabulary of the Totozoquean language family,\" indicates whether the word is proposed to have originated from the Totozoquean language family, with entries of either \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nThere are four data rows, each corresponding to a different language family:\n\n1. The first row is for the Muskogean family. The \"Word (language)\" cell lists three terms: \"tanchi’ (Chickasaw); tanchi (Choctaw); vce (Muscogee, pronounced 'uh-chi').\" The English translation is \"corn.\" The proposed Totozoquean origin is \"no.\"\n2. The second row is for the Iroquoian family. The word is \"se-lu (Cherokee),\" the English translation is \"corn,\" and the proposed origin is \"no.\"\n3. The third row is for the Caddoan family. The word is \"-k’as- (Caddo),\" the English translation is \"dried corn,\" and the proposed origin is \"yes.\"\n4. The fourth row is for Chitimacha.

Two entries (Caddoan and Chitimacha) are marked \"yes\" for Totozoquean origin, while Muskogean and Iroquoian are marked \"no.\" The table includes some pronunciation guidance for the Muscogee word and distinguishes between \"corn\" and \"dried corn\" in the English translation column. There are no missing values, special symbols, footnotes, or subtotals present in the table. Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement? the origins of vocabulary pertaining to the crop vary across languages in the region, with the words for corn in Cherokee and the Muskogean languages showing no demonstrable relationship to Totozoquean vocabulary. the region is linguistically diverse, being home not only to Chitimacha and Caddo, but also to the Muskogean language family (including Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Muscogee) and to one Iroquoian language (Cherokee). corn-related vocabulary underwent changes when entering other, unrelated languages, as can be seen by the divergence of the Caddo word from the Chitimacha word it originated in. words for corn in the languages of the Muskogean family evolved from a common root, with the Muscogee word having lost certain consonant sounds still present in the Chickasaw and Choctaw words. A Choice A is the best answer. The table provides evidence that the words for corn in the Cherokee and Muskogean languages appear unrelated to those in Caddo language, which is described as closely related to the Totozoquean language family. This supports the claim that corn cultivation spread across the Southeast without necessarily spreading Totozoquean vocabulary along with it.\nChoice B is incorrect. This choice emphasizes the diversity of Southeastern languages in general, but we’re specifically looking for information about words associated with corn. Choice C is incorrect. This choice shows how words for corn can change and evolve, but we’re looking for an example that shows how some words for corn can be completely unrelated. Choice D is incorrect. This choice shows words for corn that share a common root, but we’re looking for an example that shows how some words for corn can be unrelated.",

    "Question Text": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "A": "a suitable",
    "B": "a determined",
    "C": "an arbitrary",
    "D": "an unpredictable",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. “Suitable” means “appropriate for a particular purpose.” Since the text indicates that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage, we can infer that the author believes that ballet is a very suitable artform for telling Osage stories.\nChoice B is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith’s choice was determined. That would imply that Tinker-Smith initially faced some kind of obstacle or opposition, and nothing like that is mentioned in the passage. Choice C is incorrect. The text implies the opposite of this. “Arbitrary” means “based on random choice or whim rather than reason.” But the text does give us a good reason behind the choice to tell Osage stories through ballet: two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith’s choice was “unpredictable.” Rather, the fact that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage makes ballet especially appropriate for telling Osage stories.",

In this context, \"irrelevant\" means not applicable to the matter at hand. The text explains that as a matter of logical reasoning, the source of a claim has nothing to do with the claim’s truthfulness—a claim is either true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. This context suggests that even though people may distrust a claim based on its source, the source of the claim is actually irrelevant.\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"indistinct\" would mean uncertain or not clearly recognizable.

Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indisputable\" would mean impossible to question or deny. Although the text suggests that it isn’t logical to assume a claim is false just because its source appears to be self-interested, it doesn’t go so far as to suggest that the source of a claim can’t be questioned—the text instead makes the point that from a logical standpoint, the source of a claim doesn’t matter because the claim is either true or false in and of itself. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"implicit\" would mean suggested or understood without being directly expressed. Nothing in the text suggests that logically, the source of a claim is only suggested; instead of addressing whether sources can be directly identified, the text focuses on the idea that sources don’t matter because a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates.",

Mrs. Spring Fragrance was unaware that Mr. Spring Fragrance, tired with the day’s business, had thrown himself down on the bamboo settee on the veranda, and that although his eyes were engaged in scanning the pages of the Chinese World , his ears could not help receiving the words which were borne to him through the open window.",

    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “receiving” most nearly means hearing, or perceiving sound. The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, “his ears could not help receiving the words”). The words are being perceived specifically by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window.\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance’s ears couldn’t help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don’t enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn’t make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word “carry” can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one “carries the blame” for a mistake).",

As used in this context, “rudimentary” means basic or unsophisticated. According to the text, a study of the single-celled protozoan Stentor roeseli showed that the organisms can switch strategies for escaping certain stimuli, “sophisticatedly ‘changing their minds’” and using new strategies should other strategies fail. This context suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic or rudimentary, since the study showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “aggressive,” or threatening. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of Stentor roeseli showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “evolving,” or advancing. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of Stentor roeseli showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “advantageous,” or helpful.

    "Prompt": "Text 1 The live music festival business is growing in event size and genre variety. With so many consumer options, organizers are finding ways to cement festival attendance as a special experience worth sharing. This phenomenon is linked to the growing “experiential economy,” where many find it gratifying to purchase lived experiences. To ensure a profitable event, venues need to consider the overall consumer experience, not just the band lineup. Text 2 Music festival appearances are becoming a more important part of musicians’ careers. One factor in this shift is the rising use of streaming services that allow access to huge numbers of songs for a monthly fee, subsequently reducing sales of full-length albums. With this shift in consumer behavior, musicians are increasingly dependent on revenue from live performances.",
    "Question Text": "Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",
    "A": "Consumers are more interested in paying subscription fees to stream music than in attending music festivals in person.",
    "B": "Consumers’ growing interest in purchasing experiences is mostly confined to the music industry.",
    "C": "Changing consumer behaviors are leading to changes in music-related businesses.",
    "D": "The rising consumer demand for live music festivals also generates higher demand for music streaming platforms.",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. Both authors mention how consumer behaviors have shifted, and how this affects different aspects of the music industry. Text 1 states that consumers enjoy purchasing “lived experiences,” and that this influences how organizers design music festivals. Text 2 states that consumers are using streaming services more, and that this reduces album sales and increases the importance of live performances for musicians.\nChoice A is incorrect.

    "Prompt": "King Lear is a circa 1606 play by William Shakespeare. In the play, the character of King Lear attempts to test his three daughters’ devotion to him. He later expresses regret for his actions, as is evident when he ______ blank",
    "Question Text": "Which choice most effectively uses a quotation from King Lear to illustrate the claim?",
    "A": "says of himself, “I am a man / more sinned against than sinning.”",
    "B": "says during a growing storm, “This tempest will not give me leave to ponder / On things would hurt me more.”",

    "D": "says of himself, “I will do such things— / What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be / The terrors of the earth!”",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from King Lear to illustrate the claim that King Lear expresses regret for his actions. In the quotation, Lear describes striking himself on the head—the same act he’s engaged in as he speaks, and one that suggests he’s deeply upset with himself. Referring to himself in the second person (with “thy”), the character exclaims “Beat at this gate that let thy folly in / And thy dear judgement out!” Lear refers metaphorically to his own mind as a gate that has allowed folly, or poor judgement, to enter and good judgement to escape. This suggests that Lear regrets his attempts to test his three daughters’ devotion to him, regarding those attempts as examples of the folly that has entered the gate of his mind.\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t express King Lear’s sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his belief that the harm that others have done to him (or the extent to which they have “sinned against” him) outweighs whatever harm he himself has caused by “sinning.” Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t express King Lear’s sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his thoughts about an approaching storm (“this tempest”), which he believes “will not give [him] leave to ponder,” or time to consider, the harm that he will continue to experience (“things” that “would hurt [him] more”). Choice D is incorrect because this quotation expresses King Lear’s vow to commit terrible actions (or “things” that “shall be / The terrors of the earth”) in the future, not his regret over actions that he’s already taken.",

A team of political scientists hypothesized that municipalities are much more likely to respond to firms and offer incentives if expansions can be announced in time to benefit local elected officials than if they can’t. The team contacted officials in thousands of municipalities, inquiring about incentives for a firm looking to expand and indicating that the firm would announce its expansion on a date either just before or just after the next election.",
    "Figure": "The figure is a clustered bar chart titled, on two centered lines at the top, “Municipalities’ Responses to Inquiries” and “about Potential Incentives for Firm.” The vertical axis on the left is labeled “Number of municipalities” and runs from 0 at the bottom to 1,300 at the top in increments of 100. Each 100-unit increment has a horizontal grid line spanning the plotting area and a small tick mark on the left axis, with numeric labels shown at every 100 from 0 up to 1,300. The horizontal axis has no label. Three category labels appear diagonally below the bars at about a −40° angle: “no response,” “responded to inquiry,” and “offered incentive.”\n\nEach category is represented by two adjacent vertical bars with black outlines (stroke width about 0.9). Color encodes two conditions shown in the legend: a light gray fill (#B3B3B3) denotes “announcement before election,” and a dark gray fill (#333333) denotes “announcement after election.” The legend sits within a bordered box at the bottom of the graphic and shows the two color swatches with their corresponding text.\n\nFor “no response,” the light gray bar reaches approximately 1,252.0 municipalities, and the dark gray bar reaches approximately 1,248.0. The light gray bar is about 4.0 higher than the dark gray. These are the tallest bars in the chart, extending close to the top gridline near 1,300.\n\nFor “responded to inquiry,” the light gray bar is about 207.0, and the dark gray bar is about 205.0, with the light gray about 2.0 higher. Both bars sit just above the 200 gridline.\n\nFor “offered incentive,” the light gray bar is about 126.0, and the dark gray bar is about 122.0, with the light gray about 4.0 higher. These bars are slightly above the 100 gridline.\n\nAcross categories, the “no response” bars are much taller than the other two categories. Compared within the same color, “no response” is higher than “responded to inquiry” by about 1,045.0 (before) and about 1,043.0 (after), and higher than “offered incentive” by about 1,126.0 (before) and about 1,126.0 (after). “Responded to inquiry” exceeds “offered incentive” by roughly 81.0 (before) and 83.0 (after). Within each category, the before-election bar is slightly taller than the after-election bar by small margins (about 4.0, 2.0, and 4.0 respectively). All bars share the same width and baseline at 0.

The lighter bars show what happened when the announcement was to come before the election, and the darker bars show what happened when the announcement was to come after the election.

    "C": "most established artists could become even better artists by serving as mentors.",
    "D": "finding a mentor is more important for musicians than it is for painters, writers, and other types of artists.",
    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the relationship between the AACM’s use of mentors to support young Black musicians and similar support that other organizations offer their young artists. According to the text, in service of AACM’s goal to support new works by Black musicians, AACM mentors provide beneficial training and guidance to young artists. The text goes on to say that many other art organizations support new artists in similar ways, suggesting that these organizations recognize the importance of providing opportunities for young artists to learn from mentors who are established in their field.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that technical training is more beneficial than creative guidance. The text states that AACM mentors offer both technical training and creative guidance to young artists and that other arts organizations offer similar kinds of support; however, nothing in the text suggests that young artists, or artists of any age, benefit more from technical training. Choice C is incorrect because the text is mainly concerned with the fact that established artists are mentoring young artists through AACM and other arts organizations. The text states that young musicians benefit from AACM mentors but does not address what mentors gain from the relationship, so there is no reason to conclude that most established artists could improve as artists by serving as mentors. Choice D is incorrect.

    "Prompt": "Many literary theorists distinguish between fabula , a narrative’s content, and syuzhet , a narrative’s arrangement and presentation of events. In the film The Godfather Part II , the fabula is the story of the Corleone family, and the syuzhet is the presentation of the story as it alternates between two timelines in 1901 and 1958. But literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin maintained that fabula and syuzhet are insufficient to completely describe a narrative—he held that systematic categorizations of artistic phenomena discount the subtle way in which meaning is created by interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    "A": "Literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives.",
    "B": "Literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin claimed that meaning is not inherent in a narrative but is created when an audience encounters a narrative so that narratives are interpreted differently by different people.",
    "C": "The storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II may seem unusually complicated, but they can be easily understood when two concepts from literary theory are utilized.",
    "D": "Narratives that are told out of chronological order are more difficult for audiences to understand than are narratives presented chronologically.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by explaining that many literary theorists rely on the concepts of fabula (a narrative’s content) and syuzhet (a narrative’s arrangement and presentation of events) and illustrates these concepts by explaining how they can be applied to the film The Godfather Part II . The text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that fabula and syuzhet can’t fully describe a narrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience produce meaning. Thus, the main idea is that Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives.\nChoice B is incorrect because according to the text, Mikhail Bakhtin believed that meaning was created through the interactions of the artist, narrative, and audience, not simply through the interaction between the audience and narrative; moreover, the text doesn’t address whether Bakhtin focused on the ways in which different people interpret narratives differently. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that the storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II are complicated, it discusses the film only to illustrate how the concepts of fabula and syuzhet may be applied to a narrative. The film’s storytelling methods aren’t the primary focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses The Godfather Part II , whose narrative doesn’t adhere to a single chronological order, only to illustrate the concepts of fabula (a narrative’s content) and syuzhet (a narrative’s arrangement and presentation of events). The primary focus of this text isn’t the structure of this film or of other narratives that are told out of chronological order; moreover, the text doesn’t consider whether such structures make it harder for audiences to understand narratives.",

    "text_prompt_table_figure_options_answer_rationale": "The following text is from Walt Whitman’s 1860 poem “Calamus 24.” I HEAR it is charged against me that I seek to destroy institutions; But really I am neither for nor against institutions (What indeed have I in common with them?—Or what with the destruction of them?), Only I will establish in the Mannahatta [Manhattan] and in every city of These States, inland and seaboard, And in the fields and woods, and above every keel [ship] little or large, that dents the water, Without edifices, or rules, or trustees, or any argument, The institution of the dear love of comrades.   The speaker questions an increasingly prevalent attitude, then summarizes his worldview. The speaker regrets his isolation from others, then predicts a profound change in society. The speaker concedes his personal shortcomings, then boasts of his many achievements. The speaker addresses a criticism leveled against him, then announces a grand ambition of his. D Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the overall structure of the text. The speaker begins by stating that he has heard that others are accusing him of seeking to destroy institutions. The speaker then addresses this criticism by stating that he is “neither for nor against institutions.” Instead, the speaker states that his ultimate goal is to instill “the institution of the dear love of comrades” everywhere in the country. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as an address of criticism followed by an announcement of a grand ambition.\nChoice A is incorrect. While the speaker does address an opinion of him that he believes to be untrue, he doesn’t indicate that this attitude has become increasingly prevalent. The speaker also concludes by explaining his goal for the future rather than his current worldview. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray the speaker as isolated or regretful, and the speaker gestures toward a hope for societal change but doesn’t offer an explicit prediction that it will happen. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker addresses a criticism of him that he believes to be false; he doesn’t admit any personal shortcomings. Moreover, the speaker concludes by stating a goal he has rather than showcasing his achievements.",

Greenland was where Matthew Henson made several treks between 1891 and 1909. several treks across Greenland were made by Matthew Henson between 1891 and 1909. A Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the proper noun \"Matthew Henson\" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase \"one…century.\" In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that Matthew Henson—and not another noun in the sentence—is being described as one of the few African American global explorers during the turn of the 20th century.\nChoice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase \"1891 and 1909\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that those years were one of the few African American global explorers during the turn of the 20th century. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the proper noun \"Greenland\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that Greenland was one of the few African American global explorers during the turn of the 20th century. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase \"several treks across Greenland\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the treks were one of the few African American global explorers during the turn of the 20th century.",

This context suggests that Pico feels ambivalence toward nature.\nChoice A is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “responsiveness to” nature would mean that he portrays himself as quick to react to nature, which isn’t supported by the text. Instead, the text focuses on Pico’s mixed feelings toward nature, describing him as both honoring nature’s role in his tribe’s beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in nature. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “renunciation of” nature would mean that he portrays himself as rejecting nature, which isn’t supported by the text. The text conveys that Pico demonstrates both positive and negative responses toward nature, not that he’s giving it up completely. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “mastery over” nature would mean that he portrays himself as having control over nature, which isn’t supported by the text.

    "Question Text": "Which choice best describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion?",
    "A": "The study by Meers used body-mass scaling and produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force, while the study by Cost et al. used muscular and skeletal modeling and produced the highest estimated maximum.",
    "B": "In their study, Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis to produce an estimated bite force range with a minimum of 8,000 newtons and a maximum of 34,000 newtons.",
    "C": "The bite force estimates produced by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. were similar to each other, while the estimates produced by Meers and by Gignac and Erickson each differed substantially from any other estimate.",
    "D": "The estimated maximum bite force produced by Cost et al. exceeded the estimated maximum produced by Bates and Falkingham, even though both groups of researchers used the same method to generate their estimates.",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion about bite force estimates. According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them—that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000–57,000 newtons and 35,000–63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000–235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000–34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them.\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn’t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson’s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can’t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don’t support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates.",

C Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion about bite force estimates. According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them—that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000–57,000 newtons and 35,000–63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000–235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000–34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them.\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn’t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson’s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can’t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don’t support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates.",

The estimated maximum bite force produced by Cost et al. exceeded the estimated maximum produced by Bates and Falkingham, even though both groups of researchers used the same method to generate their estimates. C Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion about bite force estimates. According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them—that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000–57,000 newtons and 35,000–63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000–235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000–34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them.\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn’t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson’s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can’t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don’t support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates.",

The dimensions of the basin have little bearing on whether or not it was filled with liquid water, and for how long, and that’s the evidence that would support the \"wet and warm\" theory.

    "text_prompt_table_figure_qtext_options_answer_rationale": "Although it’s clear that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, astronomers have debated whether the evidence of ancient water reflects a prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions—the so-called wet and warm scenario—or a brief period of melting in an otherwise consistently frozen environment. Researchers Benjamin T. Cardenas and Michael P. Lamb recently added to this debate by using data from NASA and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter to map the topography of what is now a large basin in Mars’s northern hemisphere. Cardenas and Lamb concluded that the wet and warm scenario is likely correct. Which finding about the basin, if true, would most directly support Cardenas and Lamb’s conclusion?

Its physical characteristics are most consistent with it having formed as a result of a massive but short-lived influx of liquid water. It is surrounded by channels that could have been formed either by running water or by flowing lava. B Choice B is the best answer. This choice provides direct support for the researchers’ conclusion. If the basin once held an ocean of liquid water for \"an extended time,\" that supports the \"wet and warm scenario\" on Mars, which involved a \"prolonged\" period of temperate conditions (and not just a \"brief period of melting\").\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t provide support for the researchers’ conclusions. The dimensions of the basin have little bearing on whether or not it was filled with liquid water, and for how long, and that’s the evidence that would support the \"wet and warm\" theory. Similarly, whether or not the basin was formed by an asteroid or a comet is irrelevant to the question of whether or not there was water in the basin for a long period. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not provide support for the researchers’ conclusions, but rather the opposite. A \"massive but short lived influx\" of liquid water is not the same as a \"prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions.\" It more reflects the opposing theory, a \"brief period of melting.\" Choice D is incorrect. This choice does not support Cardenas and Lamb’s conclusion. Both theories about liquid water on Mars (\"wet and warm\" and \"brief period of melting\") involve flowing water, but lava isn’t mentioned at all in the text.

The sentence effectively introduces Cathryn Halverson’s book to an audience already familiar with the Atlantic Monthly , noting the title of Halverson’s book and describing its content without providing background information about the Atlantic Monthly .\nChoice B is incorrect. The sentence introduces the Atlantic Monthly and mentions that it’s referred to in Cathryn Halverson’s book title; it doesn’t effectively introduce Halverson’s book. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence assumes that the audience is unfamiliar with the Atlantic Monthly , providing background information about the magazine; it doesn’t effectively introduce Halverson’s book to an audience already familiar with the Atlantic Monthly . Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence assumes that the audience is familiar with the Atlantic Monthly , it doesn’t effectively introduce Cathryn Halverson’s book.",

Further, the comma after \"trash\" correctly separates the noun phrase \"man-made trash\" from the supplementary phrase (\"such as plastic bags\") that describes it.\nChoice A is incorrect because a comma after \"leaves\" doesn’t match the semicolon used later to separate the second and third items in the series (\"man-made...bags\" and \"and...glue\"). Additionally, it’s not conventional to use a colon in this way to separate a supplementary phrase (\"such as plastic bags\") from the noun phrase it modifies (\"man-made trash\").

Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the fitting background of her own sensations. The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches. On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples wavered like pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and here and there the lingering green of an oak-grove.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",
    "A": "It creates a detailed image of the physical setting of the scene.",
    "B": "It establishes that a character is experiencing an internal conflict.",
    "C": "It makes an assertion that the next sentence then expands on.",
    "D": "It illustrates an idea that is introduced in the previous sentence.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text establishes that Lily can be “keenly sensitive to” scenes that serve as a “fitting background” for her feelings—that is, she’s very aware of when a setting seems to reflect her mood. The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstrates this awareness: Lily views the landscape she’s in as a large-scale reflection of her current mood, identifying with elements such as its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to illustrate an idea introduced in the previous sentence.\nChoice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in very general terms, referring to its calmness, breadth, and long stretches of land. It’s the next sentence that adds specific details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conflict. In fact, the sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape reflects her own feeling of calmness. Choice C is incorrect because the only assertion in the underlined sentence is that Lily feels that broad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, reflect her current mood, and that assertion isn’t expanded on in the next sentence. Instead, the next sentence describes specific details of the scene without connecting them to Lily’s feelings.",

Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards. Text 2 It is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka’s plays to fit neatly into three phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka’s work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount significant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time.   While the author of Text 1 believes that thinking about Soyinka’s works of theater in phases is useful, the author of Text 2 views such an approach as limiting. Although the author of Text 1 claims that Soyinka’s style as a dramatist has evolved over time, the author of Text 2 argues that Soyinka’s style has remained consistent throughout his career. The author of Text 1 considers Soyinka’s plays to showcase his strongest writing, whereas the author of Text 2 believes that Soyinka’s poetry is where he is most skilled. The author of Text 1 argues that Soyinka’s early plays were his most politically charged, whereas the author of Text 2 claims that Soyinka’s most recent plays are the most politicized. A Choice A is the best answer. The author of Text 1 states that Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, implying that this is a helpful way to understand his works. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, challenges this view and says that it overlooks potential commonalities and differences in Soyinka’s work across what Text 1 calls distinctive stylistic phases.\nChoice B is incorrect. This choice overstates the central claim of Text 2. The author of Text 2 argues against the chronological progression supported in Text 1, but does not go so far as to say that Soyinka’s style remained consistent. In fact, Text 2 points out “significant differences in styles and content” among Soyinka’s plays. Choice C is incorrect. Neither of the texts mention Soyinka’s poetry, nor do they rank his dramatic writing relative to his other work. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text discusses the political aspects of Soyinka’s plays, nor do they make any claims about whether they have changed over time.",

The text indicates that the sharks prey on the rays, which are the main predators of the oysters; if oyster abundance is found to be greater when rays are present than when rays are absent, that would suggest that rays aren’t keeping oyster abundance down, and thus that a decline in rays’ predators, which would be expected to lead to an increase in the abundance of rays, wouldn’t bring about a decline in oyster abundance as the researchers hypothesize. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays increased substantially before dusky sharks declined in regional abundance wouldn’t support the researchers’ hypothesis that the decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. Such a finding would suggest that some factor other than shark abundance led to an increase in rays’ consumption of oysters and thus to a decrease in oyster abundance, thereby weakening the researchers’ hypothesis.",

    "Prompt": "Biologist Valentina Gómez-Bahamón and her team have investigated two subspecies of the fork-tailed flycatcher bird that live in the same region in Colombia, but one subspecies migrates south for part of the year, and the other doesn’t. The researchers found that, due to slight differences in feather shape, the feathers of migratory forked-tailed flycatcher males make a sound during flight that is higher pitched than that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males. The researchers hypothesize that fork-tailed flycatcher females are attracted to the specific sound made by the males of their own subspecies, and that over time the females’ preference will drive further genetic and anatomical divergence between the subspecies.",
    "Question Text": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support Gómez-Bahamón and her team’s hypothesis?",
    "A": "The feathers located on the wings of the migratory fork-tailed flycatchers have a narrower shape than those of the nonmigratory birds, which allows them to fly long distances.",
    "B": "Over several generations, the sound made by the feathers of migratory male fork-tailed flycatchers grows progressively higher pitched relative to that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males.",
    "C": "Fork-tailed flycatchers communicate different messages to each other depending on whether their feathers create high-pitched or low-pitched sounds.",

The text indicates that although two subspecies of the birds live in the same region, the tail feathers of the migrating males make a higher-pitched sound than the tail feathers of the nonmigrating males do. Gómez-Bahamón and her team hypothesize that female fork-tailed flycatchers are attracted to the particular sound made by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will bring about additional “genetic and anatomical divergence” between the two subspecies. If it were found that the pitch generated by the tail feathers of migrating males is getting higher over successive generations, it would indicate that the shape of the migrating subspecies’ tail feathers is diverging further from that of the nonmigrating subspecies. And if females continue to prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the females of the migrating subspecies will become acclimated to increasingly higher pitches over subsequent generations, causing further divergence between the subspecies. Thus, if it were found that migrating males’ tail feathers were producing higher pitches over time, that would support the researchers’ hypothesis.\nChoice A is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding is about the shape of wing feathers and how that affects long-distance flight, whereas the hypothesis is about the shape of tail feathers and how that relates to female mate preference. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding focuses on how the tail feather sounds communicate different messages, which doesn’t address differences between the subspecies or female preferences. Choice D is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. The finding that breeding habits haven’t changed for either subspecies does not, by itself, suggest anything about female preferences or divergence between the two subspecies.",

    "A": "None of the planets have an orbital period of more than 10 days, and TOI-628 b has a mass of 6.33 Jupiters.",
    "B": "TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 153 days, and the masses of all the planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters.",

    "D": "Each of the planets has a mass greater than 0.25 Jupiters, and all except for TOI-1478 b have an orbital period of less than 10 days.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Rodriguez and colleagues’ assertion about the classifications of the five new gas exoplanets. The text describes two categories of gas planets: hot Jupiters, which have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, and warm Jupiters, which have the same mass characteristic but have orbital periods of more than 10 days. According to the table, four of the gas exoplanets discovered by Rodriguez and colleagues have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, while one of the planets has a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of more than 10 days. These data therefore support Rodriguez and colleagues’ assertion that four of the new exoplanets are hot Jupiters and one is a warm Jupiter.\nChoice A is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table shows that TOI-628 b has a mass equivalent to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that one of the planets—TOI-1478 b—does indeed have an orbital period of more than 10 days. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table does show that the masses of the five planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 10.180 days, not 153 days. Choice C is incorrect. According to the table, TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of only 4.720 days, not more than 10 days. Additionally, although the table does show that all the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, the text indicates that a planet may be classified as a hot Jupiter or a warm Jupiter based on its mass and orbital period, not on its radius, making the information about the range of the five planets’ radius values irrelevant.",

All the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, and only TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of more than 10 days. Each of the planets has a mass greater than 0.25 Jupiters, and all except for TOI-1478 b have an orbital period of less than 10 days. D Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Rodriguez and colleagues’ assertion about the classifications of the five new gas exoplanets. The text describes two categories of gas planets: hot Jupiters, which have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, and warm Jupiters, which have the same mass characteristic but have orbital periods of more than 10 days. According to the table, four of the gas exoplanets discovered by Rodriguez and colleagues have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, while one of the planets has a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of more than 10 days. These data therefore support Rodriguez and colleagues’ assertion that four of the new exoplanets are hot Jupiters and one is a warm Jupiter.\nChoice A is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table shows that TOI-628 b has a mass equivalent to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that one of the planets—TOI-1478 b—does indeed have an orbital period of more than 10 days. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table does show that the masses of the five planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 10.180 days, not 153 days. Choice C is incorrect. According to the table, TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of only 4.720 days, not more than 10 days. Additionally, although the table does show that all the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, the text indicates that a planet may be classified as a hot Jupiter or a warm Jupiter based on its mass and orbital period, not on its radius, making the information about the range of the five planets’ radius values irrelevant.",

There are no multi-level headers, merged cells, footnotes, or special formatting such as bold or italics indicated in the HTML.\n\nThe header row lists the following column names, each centered and aligned at the bottom of the header cell:\n\n1. **Exoplanet designation**\n2. **Mass (Jupiters)**\n3. **Radius (Jupiters)**\n4. **Orbital period (days)**\n5. **Distance from the Sun (parsecs)**\n\nEach row in the body of the table corresponds to a different exoplanet, with the exoplanet designation in the first column (left-aligned), and the remaining columns (2 through 5) containing numerical values that are all centered.\n\nThe five exoplanets listed, in order, are:\n- TOI-640 b\n- TOI-1601 b\n- TOI-628 b\n- TOI-1478 b\n- TOI-1333 b\n\nFor each exoplanet, the table provides the following data:\n\n**TOI-640 b**  \n- Mass: 0.88 Jupiters  \n- Radius: 1.771 Jupiters  \n- Orbital period: 5.003 days  \n- Distance from the Sun: 340 parsecs\n\n**TOI-1601 b**  \n- Mass: 0.99 Jupiters  \n- Radius: 1.239 Jupiters  \n- Orbital period: 5.331 days  \n- Distance from the Sun: 336 parsecs\n\n**TOI-628 b**  \n- Mass: 6.33 Jupiters  \n- Radius: 1.060 Jupiters  \n- Orbital period: 3.409 days  \n- Distance from the Sun: 178 parsecs\n\n**TOI-1478 b**  \n- Mass: 0.85 Jupiters  \n- Radius: 1.060 Jupiters  \n- Orbital period: 10.180 days  \n- Distance from the Sun: 153 parsecs\n\n**TOI-1333 b**  \n- Mass: 2.37 Jupiters  \n- Radius: 1.396 Jupiters  \n- Orbital period: 4.720 days  \n- Distance from the Sun: 200 parsecs\n\nAll numerical values are given to three decimal places for orbital period and radius, and to two decimal places for mass (except for TOI-628 b, which is given to two decimal places). The distances from the Sun are whole numbers. There are no missing values or special symbols such as dashes or asterisks. The data shows that TOI-628 b has the largest mass (6.33 Jupiters), while TOI-1478 b has the smallest mass (0.85 Jupiters). The largest radius is for TOI-640 b (1.771 Jupiters), and the smallest radius (1.060 Jupiters) is shared by TOI-628 b and TOI-1478 b. The longest orbital period is for TOI-1478 b (10.180 days), and the shortest is for TOI-628 b (3.409 days). The exoplanet farthest from the Sun is TOI-640 b (340 parsecs), and the closest is TOI-1478 b (153 parsecs). There are no totals, subtotals, or averages provided in the table.  None of the planets have an orbital period of more than 10 days, and TOI-628 b has a mass of 6.33 Jupiters. TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 153 days, and the masses of all the planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters. All the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, and only TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of more than 10 days. Each of the planets has a mass greater than 0.25 Jupiters, and all except for TOI-1478 b have an orbital period of less than 10 days. D Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Rodriguez and colleagues’ assertion about the classifications of the five new gas exoplanets. The text describes two categories of gas planets: hot Jupiters, which have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, and warm Jupiters, which have the same mass characteristic but have orbital periods of more than 10 days. According to the table, four of the gas exoplanets discovered by Rodriguez and colleagues have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, while one of the planets has a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of more than 10 days. These data therefore support Rodriguez and colleagues’ assertion that four of the new exoplanets are hot Jupiters and one is a warm Jupiter.\nChoice A is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table shows that TOI-628 b has a mass equivalent to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that one of the planets—TOI-1478 b—does indeed have an orbital period of more than 10 days. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table does show that the masses of the five planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 10.180 days, not 153 days. Choice C is incorrect. According to the table, TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of only 4.720 days, not more than 10 days. Additionally, although the table does show that all the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, the text indicates that a planet may be classified as a hot Jupiter or a warm Jupiter based on its mass and orbital period, not on its radius, making the information about the range of the five planets’ radius values irrelevant.",

    "text_prompt_table_figure_options_answer_rationale": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: Scientists have developed a “freeze-thaw” battery that can retain 92% of its charge after twelve weeks. The battery contains molten salt (a type of salt that liquifies when heated and solidifies at room temperature). When the salt is in a liquid state, energy flows through the battery. When the salt is in a solid state, energy stops flowing and is stored in the battery. The stored (frozen) energy can be used by reheating (thawing) the battery.   Scientists have developed a freeze-thaw battery that contains molten salt, which liquifies when heated and solidifies at room temperature. The stored energy in a freeze-thaw battery, which contains molten salt, can be used by reheating the battery. When the molten salt in a freeze-thaw battery solidifies at room temperature, energy stops flowing and can be stored in the battery. Molten salt allows a freeze-thaw battery to retain 92% of its charge after twelve weeks. C Choice C is the best answer. The sentence specifies how the salt in a freeze-thaw battery enables energy storage, explaining that energy stops flowing and can be stored when the salt solidifies at room temperature.\nChoice A is incorrect. The sentence explains some properties of molten salt; it doesn’t specify how that salt enables energy storage. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence indicates how the energy in a freeze-thaw battery can be released; it doesn’t specify how the salt in the battery enables energy storage. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence specifies how much charge the freeze-thaw battery retains when storing energy; it doesn’t specify how the salt in the battery enables energy storage.",

First, the speaker describes observing a “most beautiful” sight: a tree (“black cypress”) standing out from the golden sky behind it, looking like a person’s finger “pointing upwards” and appearing “sensitive” and “exquisite.” Then the speaker wonders about the image’s meaning, asking why the finger is black and why it’s pointing upward. Thus, the text moves from the speaker’s description of a distinctive sight in nature to her pondering about what meaning to attribute to that sight.\nChoice A is incorrect because the speaker assesses a natural sight—a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed finger—but doesn’t question the accuracy of her own assessment. Although she wonders why the finger, which is really a tree, is black and why it’s pointing, the speaker doesn’t suggest that her belief that the tree resembles a finger is wrong. Choice C is incorrect. Although the speaker describes seeing a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed finger, she wonders about that natural image (asking why the finger, which is really a tree, is black and why it’s pointing) and doesn’t give any indication that any people are present in the scene. Choice D is incorrect. Although the speaker examines and wonders about one thing in her surroundings—a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed finger—she doesn’t address her own emotional state or consider how it’s affected by her surroundings.",

    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The underlined sentence explains that contrary to what several studies would suggest, recent European governments suffered electorally after the launch of fiscal austerity programs. The text goes on to indicate that the researchers generated their findings from data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures because the data were based on cases in which governments had set austerity programs to take effect after the next election, a practice the European governments that recently suffered electorally didn’t adhere to, thus introducing a complicating factor resulting in a conflict between the research findings and recent events.\nChoice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t indicate that the discrepancy described in the text is between observations made in study settings and observations made in real-world settings. Rather, the underlined sentence indicates that the outcome of recent events is contrary to what would be expected based on the findings of several studies. Additionally, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the studies mentioned did not use real-world data; instead, the text indicates that the data used was generated under potentially different circumstances than the recent events. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present a long-standing divergence in research findings but rather a discrepancy between past research findings and recent events that the text goes on to attribute to researchers’ use of data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures. Choice D is incorrect because while the underlined sentence notes that there have been some recent exceptions to a general pattern observed in several research studies, it does not go on to attribute this exception to the researchers underestimating inconsistencies in the data. Rather, the text goes on to attribute this to a circumstance (fiscal austerity measures being implemented before an election rather than after) which adds a complicating factor into the data not accounted for in past studies.",

B Choice B is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The underlined sentence explains that contrary to what several studies would suggest, recent European governments suffered electorally after the launch of fiscal austerity programs. The text goes on to indicate that the researchers generated their findings from data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures because the data were based on cases in which governments had set austerity programs to take effect after the next election, a practice the European governments that recently suffered electorally didn’t adhere to, thus introducing a complicating factor resulting in a conflict between the research findings and recent events.\nChoice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t indicate that the discrepancy described in the text is between observations made in study settings and observations made in real-world settings. Rather, the underlined sentence indicates that the outcome of recent events is contrary to what would be expected based on the findings of several studies. Additionally, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the studies mentioned did not use real-world data; instead, the text indicates that the data used was generated under potentially different circumstances than the recent events. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present a long-standing divergence in research findings but rather a discrepancy between past research findings and recent events that the text goes on to attribute to researchers’ use of data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures. Choice D is incorrect because while the underlined sentence notes that there have been some recent exceptions to a general pattern observed in several research studies, it does not go on to attribute this exception to the researchers underestimating inconsistencies in the data.

If Washington and Mullainathan found that two years after an election, attitudes toward the winning candidate were significantly more polarized among subjects who had voted than among subjects who had been too young to vote, that would suggest that the act of voting did have an effect on the voters’ attitudes toward the candidates, which would undermine the claim that voting doesn’t change voters’ attitudes.\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding about links between subjects’ attitudes and general political orientation, regardless of age and ability to vote, wouldn’t address the presence or absence of changes in attitudes among those subjects who did actually vote. Therefore, the finding wouldn’t have any bearing on the claim that voting in an election doesn’t change a voter’s attitude toward the candidates in that election. Choice B is incorrect because a finding that positive attitudes toward a winning candidate significantly increased in the two years after the election among subjects who had been too young to vote would involve only people who didn’t vote; therefore, the finding wouldn’t have any bearing on the claim that when people do vote, the act of voting doesn’t change their attitudes toward the candidates. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that subjects in both groups were more likely to have negative attitudes than positive attitudes toward the winning candidate two years after an election would reflect all subjects’ attitudes at one particular time whether they voted or not, rather than the presence or absence of a change in voters’ attitudes after voting.

To describe the similarities and differences between ragtime music and opera To argue that more attention should be given to Joplin’s lesser-known works To encourage music lovers to listen to music by many different composers To explain how Joplin learned to compose and perform ragtime music B Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to make a case for the importance of Scott Joplin’s less famous works. The text begins by introducing Joplin’s most popular works and then goes on to assert that gaining a full understanding of Joplin’s creativity requires a consideration of his lesser-known pieces as well. The text concludes by characterizing the lesser-known works \"Pleasant Moments\" and Treemonisha as masterpieces that deserve to be famous. These details indicate that the text’s main purpose is to argue that more attention should be given to Joplin’s lesser-known works.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses some of the ragtime music and an opera that Joplin composed, it does not compare the two types of music in general. Instead, the text argues that Joplin’s lesser-known works, including his opera, deserve as much attention as his more famous ragtime pieces receive. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses only Joplin’s music and does not ask music lovers to listen to a variety of composers. Instead, the text encourages listeners to pay attention to Joplin’s lesser-known works in order to gain a full understanding of his creativity. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not discuss how Joplin learned to compose and perform ragtime music. Instead, the text focuses on Joplin’s less famous works and makes a case for their importance.",

    "Prompt": "The following text is adapted from Zora Neale Hurston’s 1921 short story “John Redding Goes to Sea.” John is a child who lives in a town in the woods. Perhaps ten-year-old John was puzzling to the folk there in the Florida woods for he was an imaginative child and fond of day-dreams. The St. John River flowed a scarce three hundred feet from his back door. On its banks at this point grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias and bay trees.

The underlined sentence depicts John sending twigs sailing down the river while he imagines them reaching “Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world,” where he wishes he could follow. This suggests that John longs to expand his life experiences beyond the Florida woods.\nChoice A is incorrect because the second and third sentences of the text provide an extended description of the riverbank where John likes to go, whereas the underlined sentence describes what John does at that location. Choice B is incorrect because the first sentence of the text suggests that John’s behavior “was puzzling” to others around him, whereas the underlined sentence concerns the content of John’s imaginings. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence elaborates on John’s imagination but doesn’t mention any other children to whom John could be compared.",

    "Prompt": "The passage of time is among the many obstacles faced by scientists who are pursuing de-extinction efforts—that is, efforts to use breeding or a mixture of cloning and genetic engineering to bring back extinct species. Specifically, researchers are concerned that the longer a species has been extinct, the less likely it is that a suitable habitat still exists for that species. Among candidate species for de-extinction, this problem would be especially concerning for the ______ blank",
    "Table": "The table is titled \"Partial List of Candidate Species for De-extinction,\" with the caption centered at the top. It consists of three columns and six rows in total: one header row and five data rows.\n\nThe column headers, all centered, are as follows (from left to right): \"Common name,\" \"Scientific name,\" and \"Became extinct.\" There are no multi-level headers or merged cells.\n\nEach data row lists a different extinct species. In the first column, the \"Common name\" is given, left-aligned and in plain text. The second column, \"Scientific name,\" presents the Latin binomial or genus name for each species, consistently italicized. The third column, \"Became extinct,\" is centered and provides either a specific year or a time period for extinction.\n\nThe five species listed are:\n1. **Huia** — Scientific name: *Heteralocha acutirostris*; Became extinct: 1907.\n2. **Caribbean monk seal** — Scientific name: *Monachus tropicalis*; Became extinct: 1952.\n3. **Passenger pigeon** — Scientific name: *Ectopistes migratorius*; Became extinct: 1914.\n4. **Saber-toothed cat** — Scientific name: *Smilodon*; Became extinct: 11,000 years before present.\n5. **Woolly mammoth** — Scientific name: *Mammuthus primigenius*; Became extinct: 6,400 years before present.\n\nAmong the extinction dates, three are given as specific years in the 20th century (1907, 1914, and 1952), while the other two are given as approximate time periods in years before present (11,000 and 6,400 years). The saber-toothed cat's extinction is the oldest listed, followed by the woolly mammoth. The Caribbean monk seal is the most recently extinct species in the table.\n\nThere are no missing values, dashes, footnotes, or special symbols. All scientific names are italicized, and there is no bold or other special formatting in the data cells. The table does not include totals, subtotals, or averages.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?",
    "A": "passenger pigeon ( Ectopistes migratorius ), which became extinct only a few years after the huia ( Heteralocha acutirostris ).",
    "B": "saber-toothed cat ( Smilodon ), which became extinct 11,000 years ago.",
    "C": "woolly mammoth ( Mammuthus primigenius ), which became extinct several thousand years before the saber-toothed cat ( Smilodon ).",
    "D": "Caribbean monk seal ( Monachus tropicalis ), which became extinct in 1952.",
    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it uses data from the table to complete the statement regarding a species for which the problem of finding a suitable habitat would be especially concerning. For each candidate species, the table lists its common name, scientific name, and when the species became extinct. The text explains that scientists pursuing de-extinction for the candidate species also consider the length of time that has passed since the species’ extinction, noting that the longer the animal has been extinct, the less likely it is that a suitable habitat would exist for the species today. The possibility of not having a suitable habitat would be especially concerning for the candidate species for which the most time has passed since its extinction. According to the table this species would be the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct 11,000 years before present.\nChoice A is incorrect because it compares the time since the extinction of the passenger pigeon to the time since the extinction of the huia instead of citing the species listed in the table that has been extinct the longest (the saber-toothed cat). The text indicates that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat exists for it today. Neither the table nor the text supports the claim that the passenger pigeon is especially vulnerable to this problem. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the less likely it is that there would be a suitable habitat available for the species today. So, the problem would be especially concerning for the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct several thousand years before the woolly mammoth did—not the other way around. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat would be available for that species today. According to the table, the Caribbean monk seal became extinct in 1952, which is the most recent extinction listed for a candidate species in the table.",

Caribbean monk seal ( Monachus tropicalis ), which became extinct in 1952. B Choice B is the best answer because it uses data from the table to complete the statement regarding a species for which the problem of finding a suitable habitat would be especially concerning. For each candidate species, the table lists its common name, scientific name, and when the species became extinct. The text explains that scientists pursuing de-extinction for the candidate species also consider the length of time that has passed since the species’ extinction, noting that the longer the animal has been extinct, the less likely it is that a suitable habitat would exist for the species today. The possibility of not having a suitable habitat would be especially concerning for the candidate species for which the most time has passed since its extinction. According to the table this species would be the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct 11,000 years before present.\nChoice A is incorrect because it compares the time since the extinction of the passenger pigeon to the time since the extinction of the huia instead of citing the species listed in the table that has been extinct the longest (the saber-toothed cat). The text indicates that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat exists for it today. Neither the table nor the text supports the claim that the passenger pigeon is especially vulnerable to this problem. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the less likely it is that there would be a suitable habitat available for the species today. So, the problem would be especially concerning for the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct several thousand years before the woolly mammoth did—not the other way around. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat would be available for that species today.

    "Prompt": "Text 1 Stage lighting theorist Adolphe Appia was perhaps the first to argue that light must be considered alongside all the various elements of a stage to create a single, unified performance. Researcher Kelly Bremner, however, has noted that Appia lacked technical expertise in the use of light in the theater. As a result of Appia’s inexperience, Bremner argues, Appia’s theory of light called for lighting practices that weren’t possible until after the advent of electricity around 1881. Text 2 Adolphe Appia was not an amateur in the practice of lighting. Instead, it is precisely his exposure to lighting techniques at the time that contributed to his theory on the importance of light. When working as an apprentice for a lighting specialist in his youth, Appia observed the use of portable lighting devices that could be operated by hand. This experience developed his understanding of what was possible in the coordination of elements on the stage.",
    "Question Text": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim about Appia’s level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1?",
    "A": "Many lighting technicians dismissed Appia’s ideas about light on the stage.",
    "B": "Appia likely gained a level of technical expertise during his time as an apprentice.",
    "C": "Theater practitioners who worked with Appia greatly admired his work.",
    "D": "Appia was unfamiliar with the use of music and sound in theater.",
    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. The author of Text 2 directly contradicts Bremner’s claim that Appia lacked technical expertise by stating that Appia was “not an amateur in the practice of lighting.” His experience as a lighting specialist’s apprentice would have, the author of Text 2 argues, allowed Appia to “[develop] his understanding of what was possible” with the elements of theatrical design.\nChoice A is incorrect. Neither text describes how other lighting technicians responded to Appia’s ideas. Furthermore, this claim isn’t relevant to Bremner’s evaluation of Appia’s technical expertise. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about the opinions of theater practitioners who worked with Appia, so this answer choice does not relate to the claim about Appia’s level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about Appia’s familiarity with or ignorance of the use of music and sound in theater. Both focus on his expertise (or lack thereof) in lighting.",

    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of the fossil record from the Cambrian period. In this context, “abrupt” means sudden. The text explains that the fossil record reflects the unexpected appearance and rapid diversification, or increase in variety, of animal remains during the Cambrian period.

Although the word “explosion” appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was “catastrophic,” or disastrous. In context, “explosion” refers to the rapid diversification, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record—a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversification is “elusive,” or difficult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to describe the change in the fossil record as “imminent,” or about to occur, since the text indicates that the change already occurred millions of years ago.",

    "Table": "The table is titled \"Effects of Mycorrhizal Fungi on 3 Plant Species\" and presents data for three different plant species. The table consists of four columns and four rows, including the header row.\n\nThe column headers, from left to right, are:  \n1. \"Plant species\"  \n2. \"Mycorrhizal host\"  \n3. \"Average mass of plants grown in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi (in grams)\"  \n4. \"Average mass of plants grown in soil treated to kill fungi (in grams)\"  \n\nThere are no multi-level headers or merged cells; each column has a single, clearly labeled header. The units for the average mass columns are specified as grams in parentheses.\n\nThe first column lists the plant species, which are \"Corn,\" \"Marigold,\" and \"Broccoli.\" The second column, \"Mycorrhizal host,\" indicates whether each species is a host for mycorrhizal fungi, with \"yes\" for Corn and Marigold, and \"no\" for Broccoli.\n\nThe third and fourth columns provide numerical data for the average mass of each plant species under two different soil conditions: with mycorrhizal fungi present, and with fungi killed. For Corn, the average mass is 15.1 grams in soil with fungi and 3.8 grams in soil without fungi. For Marigold, the values are 10.2 grams (with fungi) and 2.4 grams (without fungi). For Broccoli, the average mass is 7.5 grams with fungi and 7 grams without fungi.\n\nNotably, for the two species that are mycorrhizal hosts (Corn and Marigold), the average mass is substantially higher when grown in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi compared to soil where fungi have been killed. For Broccoli, which is not a mycorrhizal host, the average mass is nearly the same in both conditions (7.5 grams with fungi, 7 grams without).\n\nThere are no missing values, special symbols, totals, subtotals, averages, footnotes, or additional notes present in the table.

    "Question Text": "Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?",
    "A": "broccoli grown in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi had a slightly higher average mass than broccoli grown in soil that had been treated to kill fungi.",
    "B": "corn grown in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi had a higher average mass than broccoli grown in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi.",

    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement. The text explains that mycorrhizal hosts are plants that benefit from the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil and that some such plants produce more mass when grown in the presence of these fungi, while for nonmycorrhizal species the fungi either have no effect or may be harmful. The experiment included two mycorrhizal hosts (corn and marigold) and one nonmycorrhizal species (broccoli). Given the claim in the text that nonmycorrhizal species will see either no difference or a decrease in mass when exposed to mycorrhizal fungi, the student would likely have been surprised by the higher average mass for broccoli grown in the presence of the fungi than the broccoli grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the corn data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host corn is more massive in the presence of the fungi likely fits with what the student expected and would therefore not be surprising. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the marigold data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host marigold is more massive in the presence of the fungi is likely what the student expected and thus would not be surprising. Choice D is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the data in the table—when grown in soil treated to kill fungi, corn had an average mass of 3.8 g while broccoli had an average mass of 7g—and because making comparisons among the plants in the no-fungi condition, by itself, does not provide a basis to compare the average mass of mycorrhizal hosts and nonmycorrhizal species grown in the presence of the fungi with those grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.",

The experiment included two mycorrhizal hosts (corn and marigold) and one nonmycorrhizal species (broccoli). Given the claim in the text that nonmycorrhizal species will see either no difference or a decrease in mass when exposed to mycorrhizal fungi, the student would likely have been surprised by the higher average mass for broccoli grown in the presence of the fungi than the broccoli grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the corn data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host corn is more massive in the presence of the fungi likely fits with what the student expected and would therefore not be surprising. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the marigold data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host marigold is more massive in the presence of the fungi is likely what the student expected and thus would not be surprising. Choice D is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the data in the table—when grown in soil treated to kill fungi, corn had an average mass of 3.8 g while broccoli had an average mass of 7g—and because making comparisons among the plants in the no-fungi condition, by itself, does not provide a basis to compare the average mass of mycorrhizal hosts and nonmycorrhizal species grown in the presence of the fungi with those grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.",

The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction “but” to join the first main clause (“Human-made...fibers”) and the second main clause (“the manufacture...water”).\nChoice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can’t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice B is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’s conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction.

Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t directly mention C-type or S-type asteroids. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions that 17 percent of known asteroids are S-type asteroids, it doesn’t identify the percentage of asteroids that are C-type. Therefore, the sentence doesn’t emphasize a difference between the two types.",

Although the text mentions a shepherd, it neither indicates that the shepherd is singing nor does it compare the shepherd to the speaker. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that the speaker works hard, engaging in \"hours of toil,\" and it can be inferred that the speaker likely lives in a rural area, since cows and a cowbell can be heard nearby. However, the text does not suggest that the speaker is a farmer or feels excited about farming. Moreover, the shepherd in the text is not a literal reference to someone who herds sheep but instead a figurative description of the moon as the shepherd of the stars. Choice D is incorrect because in the text, the speaker is singing a song, not listening to others sing one.

Testing the thermomechanical properties of several commercially available SiC fibers, Ramakrishna T.

The finding suggests that ______ blank",
    "Question Text": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    "A": "unlike the two polymer-derived SiC fibers, the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber can substantially inhibit creep, provided that temperatures and loads are consistent.",
    "B": "the two polymer-derived SiC fibers likely hold similar potential for reducing the creep resistance of materials exposed to stress and elevated temperatures, thus prolonging the life span of aerospace machinery.",
    "C": "composites based on the two polymer-derived SiC fibers have chemical properties that may improve the mechanical and thermal stability of aerospace equipment to a greater extent than do composites based on the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber.",
    "D": "aerospace composites containing the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber may have the ability to withstand mechanical stress for a longer period of time than can aerospace composites containing either of the two polymer-derived SiC fibers.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of silicon carbide (SiC) fibers and creep, or deformation related to ongoing mechanical stress and elevated temperatures. The text states that Bhatt et al. found that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did. Because having a lower creep rate means that the material is slower to deform with exposure to stress, as the text explains, this finding suggests that aerospace composites made with the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber may be able to withstand mechanical stress for a longer period than those made with the other two polymer-derived SiC fibers can.\nChoice A is incorrect because it overstates the implications of the study’s findings, which have to do with the rate of a material’s deformation under stress, not the absolute degree of deformation. The text states that Bhatt et al. observed that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did, meaning only that it deformed more slowly over time under constant stress, not that it underwent less deformation overall. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t establish any similarity between the two polymer-derived SiC fibers other than that both had a higher creep rate than the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber did in Bhatt et al.’s study. Moreover, reducing a material’s resistance to creep would mean that the material becomes more susceptible to deformation with exposure to stress and elevated temperatures, which would be expected to shorten rather than prolong the lifespan of machinery made with that material. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the stability of aerospace equipment may be better improved by composites containing nitrogen-treated SiC fiber than by composites containing the two polymer-derived SiC fibers, not the other way around. The text indicates that Bhatt et al. observed that the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than the other two fibers did, meaning that it was slower to degrade under exposure to mechanical stress and elevated temperatures—suggesting that it may remain stable for longer periods.",

The text states that Bhatt et al. found that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did.

The text states that Bhatt et al. observed that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did, meaning only that it deformed more slowly over time under constant stress, not that it underwent less deformation overall. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t establish any similarity between the two polymer-derived SiC fibers other than that both had a higher creep rate than the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber did in Bhatt et al.’s study. Moreover, reducing a material’s resistance to creep would mean that the material becomes more susceptible to deformation with exposure to stress and elevated temperatures, which would be expected to shorten rather than prolong the lifespan of machinery made with that material.

Ke Dong and her team found that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating just one odor receptor—and this receptor, Or31 , is present in all mosquito species known to carry diseases. Therefore, the researchers suggest that in developing new repellents, it would be most useful to ______ blank",
    "Question Text": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    "A": "identify molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors.",
    "B": "investigate alternative methods for extracting EBF molecules from chrysanthemums.",
    "C": "verify the precise locations of Or31 and other odor receptors on mosquitoes’ antennae.",
    "D": "determine the maximum number of different odor receptors that can be activated by a single molecule.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of mosquito repellents. The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to activate multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes’ antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team’s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes.\nChoice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes’ antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should instead search for additional molecular components that, like EBF, activate the one odor receptor that is known to be shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes.",

A Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of mosquito repellents. The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to activate multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes’ antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team’s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes.\nChoice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes’ antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should instead search for additional molecular components that, like EBF, activate the one odor receptor that is known to be shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes.",

    "Prompt": "Employing high-performance liquid chromatography—a process that uses pressurized water to separate material into its component molecules—astrochemist Yashiro Oba and colleagues analyzed two samples of the Murchison meteorite that landed in Australia as well as soil from the landing zone of the meteorite to determine the concentrations of various organic molecules. By comparing the relative concentrations of types of molecules known as nucleobases in the Murchison meteorite with those in the soil, the team concluded that there is evidence that the nucleobases in the Murchison meteorite formed in space and are not the result of contamination on Earth.",
    "Table": "The table is titled “Nucleobase Concentrations from Murchison Meteorite and Soil Samples in Parts per Billion.” It presents quantitative data on five different nucleobases, measured in three different samples: two from the Murchison meteorite and one from Murchison soil.\n\nThe table has four columns and six rows, including the header row. The column headers, from left to right, are: “Nucleobase,” “Murchison meteorite sample 1,” “Murchison meteorite sample 2,” and “Murchison soil sample.” The first column lists the names of the nucleobases, while the other three columns provide the measured concentrations for each nucleobase in the respective samples.\n\nThe nucleobases listed in the first column, from top to bottom, are: Isoguanine, Purine, Xanthine, Adenine, and Hypoxanthine.\n\nFor Isoguanine, the concentration is 0.5 parts per billion in Murchison meteorite sample 1, 0.04 in sample 2, and “not detected” in the soil sample. For Purine, the values are 0.2 in sample 1, 0.02 in sample 2, and again “not detected” in the soil sample. For Xanthine, the concentrations are 39 in sample 1, 3 in sample 2, and 1 in the soil sample. Adenine shows 15 in sample 1, 1 in sample 2, and 40 in the soil sample. Hypoxanthine has values of 24 in sample 1, 1 in sample 2, and 2 in the soil sample.\n\nThere are no merged cells, subtotals, totals, averages, footnotes, or special formatting such as bold or italics. The phrase “not detected” appears in the soil sample column for Isoguanine and Purine, indicating that these nucleobases were not found in the soil sample, while all other cells contain numerical values. The numerical values vary widely, with some nucleobases (such as Xanthine and Adenine) showing much higher concentrations in certain samples compared to others. For example, Xanthine is highest in meteorite sample 1 (39), while Adenine is highest in the soil sample (40). The lowest nonzero values are for Purine and Isoguanine in meteorite sample 2 (0.02 and 0.04, respectively).",

    "A": "Isoguanine and purine were detected in both meteorite samples but not in the soil sample.",

The researchers concluded that the meteorite’s nucleobases weren’t the result of soil contamination. If the nucleobases are present in both the soil and meteorite, then it’s possible that these nucleobases came from the soil. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the table.

The column headers, from left to right, are: “Nucleobase,” “Murchison meteorite sample 1,” “Murchison meteorite sample 2,” and “Murchison soil sample.” The first column lists the names of the nucleobases, while the other three columns provide the measured concentrations for each nucleobase in the respective samples.\n\nThe nucleobases listed in the first column, from top to bottom, are: Isoguanine, Purine, Xanthine, Adenine, and Hypoxanthine.\n\nFor Isoguanine, the concentration is 0.5 parts per billion in Murchison meteorite sample 1, 0.04 in sample 2, and “not detected” in the soil sample. For Purine, the values are 0.2 in sample 1, 0.02 in sample 2, and again “not detected” in the soil sample. For Xanthine, the concentrations are 39 in sample 1, 3 in sample 2, and 1 in the soil sample. Adenine shows 15 in sample 1, 1 in sample 2, and 40 in the soil sample.

    "D": "the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species.",
    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.",

B Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.",

As they began reading it in class, some students remarked that they found the novel’s letter format daunting and its treatment of gender relations old-fashioned.

    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ana Castillo’s 1986 novel The Mixquiahuala Letters . The text states that the novel consists entirely of letters from the narrator to her friend—a format that some students reading the novel in a class found intimidating. According to the text, those students also found the novel’s treatment of gender to be old-fashioned. In response to the students’ concerns, their professor emphasized the novel’s relevance: it’s written in modern-sounding language and addresses issues that still matter. This, in turn, suggests that The Mixquiahuala Letters is more relevant to contemporary audiences than it may initially seem.\nChoice A is incorrect because the professor’s response to the students only mentions The Mixquiahuala Letters : it doesn’t compare the novel to others from the same period. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the professor’s response to the students compares The Mixquiahuala Letters to contemporary novels about friendship. Choice D is incorrect because the professor’s response to the students doesn’t address the idea of reading the novel’s letters multiple times and in different orders.",

    "Prompt": "Tides can deposit large quantities of dead vegetation within a salt marsh, smothering healthy plants and leaving a salt panne—a depression devoid of plants that tends to trap standing water—in the marsh’s interior. Ecologist Kathryn Beheshti and colleagues found that burrowing crabs living within these pannes improve drainage by loosening the soil, leading the pannes to shrink as marsh plants move back in. At salt marsh edges, however, crab-induced soil loosening can promote marsh loss by accelerating erosion, suggesting that the burrowing action of crabs ______ blank",
    "Question Text": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    "A": "can be beneficial to marshes with small pannes but can be harmful to marshes with large pannes.",

    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. The text says that crab burrowing in the pannes enables plants to grow there again. It also says that crab burrowing at the edges of the marsh speeds up marsh loss. This suggests that burrowing crabs can either help or hurt marshes, depending on where they’re located.\nChoice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses pannes of different sizes. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never suggests that crabs do more burrowing in the pannes (the areas with standing water) than they do at the edges. Rather, the text says that the burrowing that happens in the pannes is beneficial, while the burrowing that happens at the edges is harmful. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported.

    "D": "Since 1984, new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors have often been compared to The House on Mango Street .",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence. The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros’s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character’s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood.\nChoice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn’t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren’t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella’s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren’t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that The House on Mango Street has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn’t relate directly to the text’s claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros’s The House on Mango Stree t would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros’s novella, such similarities wouldn’t necessarily be evidence of the novella’s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how The House on Mango Street had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella’s influence.",

The House on Mango Street has sold over six million copies and is one of the most commonly read books among high school and university students in the US. Since 1984, new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors have often been compared to The House on Mango Street . A Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence. The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros’s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character’s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood.\nChoice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn’t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren’t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella’s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren’t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that The House on Mango Street has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn’t relate directly to the text’s claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros’s The House on Mango Stree t would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros’s novella, such similarities wouldn’t necessarily be evidence of the novella’s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities.

    "text_prompt_table_figure_options_answer_rationale": "San Francisco is known for the colorful murals painted on many of its buildings. The densest collection of murals is found on Balmy Alley in the Mission District neighborhood. In the 1970s, Latina artists painted vivid scenes of community life on walls along this block. As the original murals have faded, later generations of artists have painted new ones over them. As a result, Balmy Alley has become a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit, with its murals reflecting changes in the cultural life of the city.   To compare the Balmy Alley murals to other murals in San Francisco To offer an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals To urge people to protect the murals of San Francisco from decay To describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco beginning in the 1970s B Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city’s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco’s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn’t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals—or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as “a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit,” the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District.",

Brierley et al.’s research directly challenges Wright’s claim that pastoralism turned the Sahara into a desert, suggesting that, in a Sahara that turned arid 500 years earlier than previously thought, pastoral practices may have actually “preserved vegetation” rather than depleting it.\nChoice B is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research actually disputes the idea that any Neolithic peoples’ behaviors, including pastoralism, could have contributed to the Sahara’s changing climate. In fact, their research implies that the Neolithic peoples’ practices did not “exacerbate aridity” (i.e., make things worse), but may have slowed environmental changes. Choice C is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research does not acknowledge that pastoralism can have deleterious (i.e., negative) effects on a region’s vegetation and climate. It only describes one possible beneficial effect: preserving vegetation through practices like selective grazing. Choice D is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research does not call for more research into factors that likely contributed to the desertification of the Sahara region.",

Subject-modifier placement requires a modifier and its subject to be next to each other. The subject of the modifier \"a coming-of-age story…colonialism\" is Chraïbi’s novel The Simple Past , so the subject \"Chraïbi’s debut novel\" fits perfectly after this introductory modifying phrase.\nChoice A is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The introductory modifier \"a coming-of-age story…colonialism\" is describing Chraïbi’s novel, not Morocco. However, this choice places Morocco directly next to that modifier. Choice C is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The introductory modifier \"a coming-of-age story…colonialism\" all describes Chraïbi’s novel, not Chraïbi himself. However, this choice places Chraïbi directly next to that modifier. Choice D is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier \"a coming-of-age story…\" is describing Chraïbi’s novel, so that needs to be the subject immediately after the modifier. This choice adds another modifier that describes Chraïbi’s novel, but then puts \"Chraïbi\" himself—not the novel—right after that modifier, which doesn’t make sense. Chraïbi wasn’t \"published two years before\" Moroccan independence; his novel The Simple Past was.",

    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of A. mexicanus . According to the text, A. mexicanus , a river-dwelling fish species, has colonized caves. The fish that live in rivers and those that live in caves show no significant genetic differences and are all capable of making the same sounds. The text indicates, however, that Hyacinthe and colleagues found that sounds that the river fish use in a particular context and for a particular purpose are used in a different context and for a different purpose by the cave fish. Additionally, the sounds made by cave fish show some differences depending on the specific cave the fish inhabit. The text goes on to state that Hyacinthe and colleagues have noted that differences in how the fish use sound to communicate could eventually become so great that they prevent fish from different locations from interbreeding. In other words, the river fish might eventually only breed with other river fish (with whom they share characteristics regarding sonic communication that they do not share with cave fish), while the cave fish might only breed with other cave fish for a similar reason. In context, this observation suggests that even though the fish are a single species right now, they could be in the process of splitting into distinct populations with different characteristics.\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text suggesting that the river fish are less reliant on sonic communication than the cave fish are. Although the text does indicate that the river fish and cave fish are genetically similar, the text describes both groups as using sonic communication and says nothing to indicate that one group depends on that communication more than the other group does. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that all members of the species can emit the same sounds but that the function and context of sounds differ depending on whether the fish live in rivers or caves, but it does not indicate that river fish produce sounds that cave fish do not or vice versa. Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts the text.

    "D": "He has altered his approach to sculpture over time, and his works have become increasingly abstract.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, many of Richard Hunt’s sculptures “use broad forms rather than extreme accuracy”—in other words, they are more abstract than realistic. To illustrate Hunt’s abstract approach, the text characterizes his sculpture of Arachne as “vaguely human” and his work in honor of Ida B. Wells as “using mainly flowing, curved pieces of metal that create stylized flame.” Thus, the main idea is that Hunt often depicts the subjects of his sculptures using an unrealistic style.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that one of Hunt’s sculptures is made of steel and another of bronze, there is no mention of why he chose these materials. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt chose the subjects for his sculptures. Furthermore, of the two examples provided in the text, only Ida B. Wells is an important historical figure; Arachne is a “mythical character.” Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt’s style changed over time. In fact, although the two examples of Hunt’s work discussed in the text were created 65 years apart, they are both described as heavily stylized rather than realistic, which may suggest that some aspects of Hunt’s style haven’t changed over that time.",

He uses different kinds of materials depending on what kind of sculpture he plans to create. He tends to base his art on important historical figures rather than on fictional characters. He has altered his approach to sculpture over time, and his works have become increasingly abstract. A Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, many of Richard Hunt’s sculptures “use broad forms rather than extreme accuracy”—in other words, they are more abstract than realistic. To illustrate Hunt’s abstract approach, the text characterizes his sculpture of Arachne as “vaguely human” and his work in honor of Ida B. Wells as “using mainly flowing, curved pieces of metal that create stylized flame.” Thus, the main idea is that Hunt often depicts the subjects of his sculptures using an unrealistic style.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that one of Hunt’s sculptures is made of steel and another of bronze, there is no mention of why he chose these materials. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt chose the subjects for his sculptures. Furthermore, of the two examples provided in the text, only Ida B. Wells is an important historical figure; Arachne is a “mythical character.” Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt’s style changed over time. In fact, although the two examples of Hunt’s work discussed in the text were created 65 years apart, they are both described as heavily stylized rather than realistic, which may suggest that some aspects of Hunt’s style haven’t changed over that time.",

The graph shows the number of visits for recreation to each of these parks during the three-month period with the highest number of visitors. A student notes that among the parks shown in the graph, the park with the highest monthly recreation visits in all three months was ______ blank",
    "Figure": "The figure is a line graph titled “Recreation Visits by Month to Four US National Parks during the Peak Season in 2021.” The horizontal axis is labeled “Month,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Number of recreation visits (in thousands of visitors).” The vertical scale runs from 0 to 1,100, marked every 100 (0, 100, 200, …, 1,100). Thin horizontal grid lines span the plotting area at each 100-unit tick, from y=346 (0) up to y=96 (1,100). The vertical plotting boundary at the left is a thin line at x≈118.6. Three thin vertical guide lines mark the months at x≈159.7, 241.8, and 323.9, with the tick labels “June,” “July,” and “August,” respectively, placed below and rotated about 40 degrees counterclockwise. The axis label “Month” appears centered below the chart.\n\nA legend appears in a rectangular box below the plot. It shows four line styles with their labels to the right. “Yellowstone” is encoded by a solid black line (stroke width about 2.4) with small black triangular markers at the data points. “Zion” is a black dashed line (dash pattern long dashes, stroke width about 2.4) with square markers (light gray fill with black outline). “Grand Canyon” is a black dotted line (very short dashes with round caps, stroke width about 3) with white circular markers outlined in black. “Rocky Mountain” is a medium-gray line (stroke color #999, thicker at about 3.5) with star/diamond-shaped markers (gray fill, black outline).\n\nEach series has two connecting segments, from June to July and from July to August, with the markers appearing at the three month positions. Reading from the vertical scale (in thousands of visitors):\n- Yellowstone: June is at about 939; July rises to about 1,081; August falls to about 922. Thus, it increases by about 142 from June to July, then decreases by about 159 from July to August.\n- Zion: June is about 676; July is about 581; August is about 467. This declines by about 95 from June to July and by about 114 from July to August, a steady month-by-month decrease.\n- Grand Canyon: June is about 539; July rises slightly to about 557; August drops to about 431. That is an increase of about 18 from June to July, then a decrease of about 126 from July to August.\n- Rocky Mountain: June is about 671; July jumps to about 905; August eases to about 746. That is an increase of about 234 from June to July, followed by a decrease of about 159 from July to August.\n\nComparing parks within each month, Yellowstone is highest each month: about 939 in June (top among the four), about 1,081 in July (near the top of the chart, between the 1,000 and 1,100 grid lines), and about 922 in August. In June, Zion (about 676) is slightly above Rocky Mountain (about 671) by around 5, and both exceed Grand Canyon (about 539) by roughly 132 and 137, respectively. In July, Yellowstone (about 1,081) leads Rocky Mountain (about 905) by about 176; Zion (about 581) is above Grand Canyon (about 557) by about 24. In August, Yellowstone (about 922) is again highest, ahead of Rocky Mountain (about 746) by about 176; Zion (about 467) remains above Grand Canyon (about 431) by about 36. No series cross one another over the three months; Zion remains above Grand Canyon in all three, and Rocky Mountain remains below Yellowstone but above Grand Canyon throughout, overtaking Zion after June.

Choice D is incorrect. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Grand Canyon National Park was approximately 540,000 in June, about 560,000 in July, and about 430,000 in August, each of which is lower than the total visits to Yellowstone in the same months.",

Reading from the vertical scale (in thousands of visitors):\n- Yellowstone: June is at about 939; July rises to about 1,081; August falls to about 922. Thus, it increases by about 142 from June to July, then decreases by about 159 from July to August.\n- Zion: June is about 676; July is about 581; August is about 467. This declines by about 95 from June to July and by about 114 from July to August, a steady month-by-month decrease.\n- Grand Canyon: June is about 539; July rises slightly to about 557; August drops to about 431. That is an increase of about 18 from June to July, then a decrease of about 126 from July to August.\n- Rocky Mountain: June is about 671; July jumps to about 905; August eases to about 746. That is an increase of about 234 from June to July, followed by a decrease of about 159 from July to August.\n\nComparing parks within each month, Yellowstone is highest each month: about 939 in June (top among the four), about 1,081 in July (near the top of the chart, between the 1,000 and 1,100 grid lines), and about 922 in August. In June, Zion (about 676) is slightly above Rocky Mountain (about 671) by around 5, and both exceed Grand Canyon (about 539) by roughly 132 and 137, respectively.

In all three months, the number of visits to Yellowstone was higher than the number of visits to any other park in each month.\nChoice A is incorrect. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Zion National Park was approximately 680,000 in June, about 580,000 in July, and about 470,000 in August, each of which is lower than the number of visits to Yellowstone in the same months. Choice B is incorrect. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Rocky Mountain National Park was approximately 670,000 in June, about 900,000 in July, and about 750,000 in August, each of which is lower than the number of visits to Yellowstone in the same months. Choice D is incorrect. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Grand Canyon National Park was approximately 540,000 in June, about 560,000 in July, and about 430,000 in August, each of which is lower than the total visits to Yellowstone in the same months.",

C Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about the US national park with the highest number of recreation visits during a three-month period. The line graph shows the number of recreation visits to four US national parks for the months of June, July, and August 2021. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Yellowstone National Park in June was approximately 940,000; in July, the number of visits was approximately 1,080,000; and in August, the number of visits was approximately 920,000. In all three months, the number of visits to Yellowstone was higher than the number of visits to any other park in each month.\nChoice A is incorrect. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Zion National Park was approximately 680,000 in June, about 580,000 in July, and about 470,000 in August, each of which is lower than the number of visits to Yellowstone in the same months. Choice B is incorrect. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Rocky Mountain National Park was approximately 670,000 in June, about 900,000 in July, and about 750,000 in August, each of which is lower than the number of visits to Yellowstone in the same months. Choice D is incorrect. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Grand Canyon National Park was approximately 540,000 in June, about 560,000 in July, and about 430,000 in August, each of which is lower than the total visits to Yellowstone in the same months.",

According to the researchers, the findings suggest that across the years analyzed, there was a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies.",
    "Figure": "The graphic is a vertical bar chart titled in two centered lines at the top: “Average Number of Individuals” and “Reporting Directly to CEOs.” The horizontal axis is labeled “Years” at the bottom center. The vertical axis label runs vertically along the left in two stacked lines: “Average number of individuals” and “directly reporting to CEO.” The vertical scale runs from 0 at the bottom to 7 at the top, with major tick marks and horizontal grid lines at each integer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The grid lines are thin, solid black lines extending across the plotting area, and the left axis line is a thin, solid black line. Each tick has a short tick mark on the axis and a number printed just to the left.\n\nAlong the horizontal axis there are three labeled groups, each denoted by a slanted (about 40 degrees up to the left) text label under the bars: “1991–1995,” “1996–2001,” and “2001–2008.” In each group, two adjacent vertical bars are shown: the left bar is light gray (hex #B3B3B3) and the right bar is dark gray (hex #333333). Both bar types have thin black outlines. A boxed legend near the bottom shows the encoding: a small light gray square labeled “managers” and a small dark gray square labeled “department leaders.”\n\nReading bar heights against the vertical grid:\n- For 1991–1995, the light gray (managers) bar reaches exactly the “2” grid line, about 2.0; the dark gray (department leaders) bar reaches about one-third of the way between 3 and 4, about 3.3. The dark bar is about 1.3 units higher than the light bar.\n- For 1996–2001, the light gray bar is midway between 2 and 3, about 2.5; the dark gray bar reaches exactly the “4” grid line, 4.0. Here the dark bar is about 1.5 units higher.\n- For 2001–2008, the light gray bar reaches exactly the “3” grid line, 3.0; the dark gray bar rises to just below the “7” grid line, at about 6.8. The dark bar exceeds the light bar by about 3.8 units.\n\nAcross the three groups, the light gray bars increase steadily from about 2.0 to 2.5 to 3.0. The dark gray bars also increase, from about 3.3 to 4.0 to 6.8. In every group the dark gray bar is taller than the light gray bar, with the gap widening over time. None of the bars exceed the top scale value of 7, and all bars rest on the zero baseline at the bottom. The tallest bar overall is the dark gray bar in 2001–2008 (about 6.8), and the shortest is the light gray bar in 1991–1995 (2.0). The bars align with the grid lines where stated (for example, managers in 2001–2008 at exactly 3.0 and department leaders in 1996–2001 at exactly 4.0), making the approximate readings above evident from the tick marks.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion?",
    "A": "The average numbers of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO didn’t fluctuate from the 1991–1995 period to the 2001–2008 period.",
    "B": "The average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 1996–2001 period.",
    "C": "The average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO was greater than the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO in each of the three periods studied.",
    "D": "The average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that there is a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies. The graph shows the average number of individuals reporting directly to CEOs during three different time periods: the individuals are divided into managers and department leaders. The average number of department leaders directly reporting to their CEO during the 1991–1995 period was slightly more than three, during the 1996–2001 period it was four, and during the 2001–2008 period it was almost seven. Thus, the average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied, which suggests that CEOs were connecting with more departments.\nChoice A is incorrect because the average number of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose for both categories between the 1991–1995 and 2001–2008 periods; thus, it isn’t true that the average numbers didn’t fluctuate. Choice B is incorrect because the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 2001–2008 period, not in the 1996–2001 period. Choice C is incorrect. Although it correctly describes a feature of the graph, the observation that more department leaders than managers are reporting to CEOs does not by itself address the question of whether CEOs are connecting with more departments over time—to address that question, one needs to know whether the number of department leaders reporting to CEOs is increasing over time.",

The graphic is a vertical bar chart titled in two centered lines at the top: “Average Number of Individuals” and “Reporting Directly to CEOs.” The horizontal axis is labeled “Years” at the bottom center. The vertical axis label runs vertically along the left in two stacked lines: “Average number of individuals” and “directly reporting to CEO.” The vertical scale runs from 0 at the bottom to 7 at the top, with major tick marks and horizontal grid lines at each integer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The grid lines are thin, solid black lines extending across the plotting area, and the left axis line is a thin, solid black line. Each tick has a short tick mark on the axis and a number printed just to the left.\n\nAlong the horizontal axis there are three labeled groups, each denoted by a slanted (about 40 degrees up to the left) text label under the bars: “1991–1995,” “1996–2001,” and “2001–2008.” In each group, two adjacent vertical bars are shown: the left bar is light gray (hex #B3B3B3) and the right bar is dark gray (hex #333333). Both bar types have thin black outlines. A boxed legend near the bottom shows the encoding: a small light gray square labeled “managers” and a small dark gray square labeled “department leaders.”\n\nReading bar heights against the vertical grid:\n- For 1991–1995, the light gray (managers) bar reaches exactly the “2” grid line, about 2.0; the dark gray (department leaders) bar reaches about one-third of the way between 3 and 4, about 3.3. The dark bar is about 1.3 units higher than the light bar.\n- For 1996–2001, the light gray bar is midway between 2 and 3, about 2.5; the dark gray bar reaches exactly the “4” grid line, 4.0. Here the dark bar is about 1.5 units higher.\n- For 2001–2008, the light gray bar reaches exactly the “3” grid line, 3.0; the dark gray bar rises to just below the “7” grid line, at about 6.8. The dark bar exceeds the light bar by about 3.8 units.\n\nAcross the three groups, the light gray bars increase steadily from about 2.0 to 2.5 to 3.0. The dark gray bars also increase, from about 3.3 to 4.0 to 6.8. In every group the dark gray bar is taller than the light gray bar, with the gap widening over time.

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion? The average numbers of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO didn’t fluctuate from the 1991–1995 period to the 2001–2008 period. The average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 1996–2001 period. The average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO was greater than the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO in each of the three periods studied. The average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied. D Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that there is a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies. The graph shows the average number of individuals reporting directly to CEOs during three different time periods: the individuals are divided into managers and department leaders. The average number of department leaders directly reporting to their CEO during the 1991–1995 period was slightly more than three, during the 1996–2001 period it was four, and during the 2001–2008 period it was almost seven. Thus, the average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied, which suggests that CEOs were connecting with more departments.\nChoice A is incorrect because the average number of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose for both categories between the 1991–1995 and 2001–2008 periods; thus, it isn’t true that the average numbers didn’t fluctuate. Choice B is incorrect because the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 2001–2008 period, not in the 1996–2001 period. Choice C is incorrect. Although it correctly describes a feature of the graph, the observation that more department leaders than managers are reporting to CEOs does not by itself address the question of whether CEOs are connecting with more departments over time—to address that question, one needs to know whether the number of department leaders reporting to CEOs is increasing over time.",

None of the bars exceed the top scale value of 7, and all bars rest on the zero baseline at the bottom. The tallest bar overall is the dark gray bar in 2001–2008 (about 6.8), and the shortest is the light gray bar in 1991–1995 (2.0).

The average numbers of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO didn’t fluctuate from the 1991–1995 period to the 2001–2008 period. The average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 1996–2001 period. The average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO was greater than the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO in each of the three periods studied. The average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied. D",
    "text_prompt_table_figure_options_answer_rationale": "For each data category, the following bars are shown: managers department leaders managers department leaders All values are approximate. The data for the 3 categories are as follows: 1991–1995: managers: 2 department leaders: 3.2 1996–2001: managers: 2.5 department leaders: 4 2001–2008: managers: 3 department leaders: 6.9 1991–1995: managers: 2 department leaders: 3.2 managers: 2 department leaders: 3.2 1996–2001: managers: 2.5 department leaders: 4 managers: 2.5 department leaders: 4 2001–2008: managers: 3 department leaders: 6.9 managers: 3 department leaders: 6.9 Considering a large sample of companies, economics experts Maria Guadalupe, Julie Wulf, and Raghuram Rajan assessed the number of managers and leaders from different departments who reported directly to a chief executive officer (CEO). According to the researchers, the findings suggest that across the years analyzed, there was a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies.  The graphic is a vertical bar chart titled in two centered lines at the top: “Average Number of Individuals” and “Reporting Directly to CEOs.” The horizontal axis is labeled “Years” at the bottom center. The vertical axis label runs vertically along the left in two stacked lines: “Average number of individuals” and “directly reporting to CEO.” The vertical scale runs from 0 at the bottom to 7 at the top, with major tick marks and horizontal grid lines at each integer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The grid lines are thin, solid black lines extending across the plotting area, and the left axis line is a thin, solid black line. Each tick has a short tick mark on the axis and a number printed just to the left.\n\nAlong the horizontal axis there are three labeled groups, each denoted by a slanted (about 40 degrees up to the left) text label under the bars: “1991–1995,” “1996–2001,” and “2001–2008.” In each group, two adjacent vertical bars are shown: the left bar is light gray (hex #B3B3B3) and the right bar is dark gray (hex #333333). Both bar types have thin black outlines. A boxed legend near the bottom shows the encoding: a small light gray square labeled “managers” and a small dark gray square labeled “department leaders.”\n\nReading bar heights against the vertical grid:\n- For 1991–1995, the light gray (managers) bar reaches exactly the “2” grid line, about 2.0; the dark gray (department leaders) bar reaches about one-third of the way between 3 and 4, about 3.3. The dark bar is about 1.3 units higher than the light bar.\n- For 1996–2001, the light gray bar is midway between 2 and 3, about 2.5; the dark gray bar reaches exactly the “4” grid line, 4.0.

The dark bar exceeds the light bar by about 3.8 units.\n\nAcross the three groups, the light gray bars increase steadily from about 2.0 to 2.5 to 3.0. The dark gray bars also increase, from about 3.3 to 4.0 to 6.8. In every group the dark gray bar is taller than the light gray bar, with the gap widening over time. None of the bars exceed the top scale value of 7, and all bars rest on the zero baseline at the bottom. The tallest bar overall is the dark gray bar in 2001–2008 (about 6.8), and the shortest is the light gray bar in 1991–1995 (2.0). The bars align with the grid lines where stated (for example, managers in 2001–2008 at exactly 3.0 and department leaders in 1996–2001 at exactly 4.0), making the approximate readings above evident from the tick marks. The average numbers of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO didn’t fluctuate from the 1991–1995 period to the 2001–2008 period. The average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 1996–2001 period. The average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO was greater than the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO in each of the three periods studied. The average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied. D Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that there is a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies. The graph shows the average number of individuals reporting directly to CEOs during three different time periods: the individuals are divided into managers and department leaders. The average number of department leaders directly reporting to their CEO during the 1991–1995 period was slightly more than three, during the 1996–2001 period it was four, and during the 2001–2008 period it was almost seven. Thus, the average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied, which suggests that CEOs were connecting with more departments.\nChoice A is incorrect because the average number of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose for both categories between the 1991–1995 and 2001–2008 periods; thus, it isn’t true that the average numbers didn’t fluctuate. Choice B is incorrect because the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 2001–2008 period, not in the 1996–2001 period. Choice C is incorrect. Although it correctly describes a feature of the graph, the observation that more department leaders than managers are reporting to CEOs does not by itself address the question of whether CEOs are connecting with more departments over time—to address that question, one needs to know whether the number of department leaders reporting to CEOs is increasing over time.",

    "Prompt": "Text 1 Because literacy in Nahuatl script, the writing system of the Aztec Empire, was lost after Spain invaded central Mexico in the 1500s, it is unclear exactly how meaning was encoded in the script’s symbols. Although many scholars had assumed that the symbols signified entire words, linguist Alfonso Lacadena theorized in 2008 that they signified units of language smaller than words: individual syllables. Text 2 The growing consensus among scholars of Nahuatl script is that many of its symbols could signify either words or syllables, depending on syntax and content at any given site within a text. For example, the symbol signifying the word huipil (blouse) in some contexts could signify the syllable “pil” in others, as in the place name “Chipiltepec.” Thus, for the Aztecs, reading required a determination of how such symbols functioned each time they appeared in a text.",

Lacadena’s theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signified syllables, but the consensus described in Text 2 is that they can signify either symbols or full words, depending on the context.

The migration’s obligate nature is why diadromous fish can be ______ blank those that are merely euryhaline (able to tolerate high salinity): the euryhaline blackchin tilapia can survive high salinity, but its life cycle does not involve relocation to a different biome, as does that of the diadromous wild salmon.   demarcated from reconstituted as conflated with derived from A Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of diadromous fish. In this context, \"demarcated from\" means separate or set apart from. The text indicates that diadromous fish differ from euryhaline fish in that diadromous fish \"migrate between freshwater and marine biomes during their life,\" whereas euryhaline fish do not relocate to a different biome because they can tolerate higher salinity environments. Therefore, this context suggests that because of differences between their migration patterns, diadromous fish are distinct and can be demarcated from euryhaline fish.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text states that diadromous fish migrate and relocate, the text does not suggest that diadromous fish would be \"reconstituted as,\" or formed again as, anything new. Only their environments change and not the fish themselves. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not suggest that diadromous fish can be \"conflated with,\" or combined with, euryhaline fish. Instead, the text distinguishes the two types of fish by pointing out their differences with regard to migration and tolerance for salinity. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that based on migration habits and tolerance for salinity, diadromous fish are different from euryhaline fish; so it would not make logical sense to say that diadromous fish would be \"derived from,\" or be an extension of or result from, euryhaline fish.",

    "Figure": "The figure is a bar graph titled “Voters’ Political Orientation, Level of Political Information, and Probability of Voting,” shown in three centered lines at the top. The vertical axis on the left is labeled “Probability of voting (%)” (rotated vertically) and runs from 0 to 100 percent. Horizontal grid lines span the plotting area at every 10 percent increment, labeled on the left margin as 0, 10, 20, …, 100. The 0% line is at the bottom of the plot area, and the 100% line is at the top. A vertical axis line runs along the left edge of the plot area. The horizontal axis shows seven categories labeled 1 through 7 below the bars. Beneath the axis, centered multi-line text explains the scale: “Voters’ political orientation (1 = strong Democrat/liberal; 4 = independent; 7 = strong Republican/conservative).”\n\nTwo series are displayed for each of the seven categories as adjacent vertical bars that share the same baseline at 0%. Within each category, the left bar is filled light gray (#B3B3B3) and represents “low information,” and the right bar is filled dark gray (#333333) and represents “high information.” All bars have black outlines of the same thin thickness. The two bars in each pair touch each other with no gap, and there is a wider gap between pairs. A legend below the chart, inside a thin rectangular box, shows a small light gray square labeled “low information” and a small dark gray square labeled “high information,” matching the fills of the bars.\n\nReading heights against the percentage grid (each 10% step equals the same vertical distance), the approximate values for each category are as follows. For category 1, the low-information bar is about 78.0% and the high-information bar is about 92.0%. For category 2, low is about 62.0% and high is about 85.0%. For category 3, low is about 57.0% and high is about 86.0%. For category 4, low is about 47.0% and high is about 80.0%. For category 5, low is about 62.0% and high is about 87.5%. For category 6, low is about 69.0% and high is about 88.0%. For category 7, low is about 81.5% and high is about 94.0%. In every category, the dark (high-information) bar is taller than the light (low-information) bar. The differences between the two bars within each category are, in percentage points: about +14.0 (category 1), +23.0 (2), +29.0 (3), +33.0 (4), +25.5 (5), +19.0 (6), and +12.5 (7). Among the low-information bars, the smallest value appears at category 4 (about 47.0%), and the largest at category 7 (about 81.5%); the low-information bars generally decline from category 1 to 4 and then rise from 4 to 7. Among the high-information bars, the smallest is also at category 4 (about 80.0%), and the largest at category 7 (about 94.0%); these bars are relatively high at category 1, dip at 4, and then rise to 7. Notably, the low-information bars for categories 2 and 5 are equal at about 62.0%.\n\nNo lines other than the grid and the left axis are drawn; there are no markers, annotations, or shaded regions beyond the legend and axis labels. All numeric tick labels, category labels, and descriptive text are rendered in a consistent serif font.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Charles and Stephens’s claim?",
    "A": "At each point on the political orientation scale, high-information voters were more likely than low-information voters to vote.",
    "B": "Only low-information voters who identify as independents had a voting probability below 50%.",
    "C": "The closer that low-information voters are to the ends of the political orientation scale, the more likely they were to vote.",
    "D": "High-information voters were more likely to identify as strong Democrats or strong Republicans than low-information voters were.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively support Charles and Stephens’s claim about how level of information affects voters. The graph shows the probability of voting for both high- and low-information voters in seven categories of political orientation. Charles and Stephens claim that “the more informed voters are about politics…the more likely they are to vote.” This statement correctly asserts that the graph shows a higher probability of voting for high-information voters than for low-information voters at each of the seven political orientations. Thus, this statement accurately cites data from the graph that support Charles and Stephens’s claim about how level of information affects voters.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the only probability in the graph below 50% is for low-information voters categorized as independent (orientation 4), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice C is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the highest probabilities of voting for low-information voters are at the ends of the orientation scale (1 and 7), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice D is incorrect because the graph does not give any information about how many people are represented in any of the categories, so this statement is not based on data from the graph. Furthermore, even if we did have this information, the claim is about how level of information affects voters’ probability of voting, not whether they’re likely to strongly identify with a particular political party.",

Within each category, the left bar is filled light gray (#B3B3B3) and represents “low information,” and the right bar is filled dark gray (#333333) and represents “high information.” All bars have black outlines of the same thin thickness. The two bars in each pair touch each other with no gap, and there is a wider gap between pairs. A legend below the chart, inside a thin rectangular box, shows a small light gray square labeled “low information” and a small dark gray square labeled “high information,” matching the fills of the bars.\n\nReading heights against the percentage grid (each 10% step equals the same vertical distance), the approximate values for each category are as follows.

For category 6, low is about 69.0% and high is about 88.0%. For category 7, low is about 81.5% and high is about 94.0%. In every category, the dark (high-information) bar is taller than the light (low-information) bar. The differences between the two bars within each category are, in percentage points: about +14.0 (category 1), +23.0 (2), +29.0 (3), +33.0 (4), +25.5 (5), +19.0 (6), and +12.5 (7). Among the low-information bars, the smallest value appears at category 4 (about 47.0%), and the largest at category 7 (about 81.5%); the low-information bars generally decline from category 1 to 4 and then rise from 4 to 7. Among the high-information bars, the smallest is also at category 4 (about 80.0%), and the largest at category 7 (about 94.0%); these bars are relatively high at category 1, dip at 4, and then rise to 7. Notably, the low-information bars for categories 2 and 5 are equal at about 62.0%.\n\nNo lines other than the grid and the left axis are drawn; there are no markers, annotations, or shaded regions beyond the legend and axis labels. All numeric tick labels, category labels, and descriptive text are rendered in a consistent serif font. Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Charles and Stephens’s claim? At each point on the political orientation scale, high-information voters were more likely than low-information voters to vote. Only low-information voters who identify as independents had a voting probability below 50%. The closer that low-information voters are to the ends of the political orientation scale, the more likely they were to vote. High-information voters were more likely to identify as strong Democrats or strong Republicans than low-information voters were. A",

The closer that low-information voters are to the ends of the political orientation scale, the more likely they were to vote. High-information voters were more likely to identify as strong Democrats or strong Republicans than low-information voters were. A Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively support Charles and Stephens’s claim about how level of information affects voters. The graph shows the probability of voting for both high- and low-information voters in seven categories of political orientation. Charles and Stephens claim that “the more informed voters are about politics…the more likely they are to vote.” This statement correctly asserts that the graph shows a higher probability of voting for high-information voters than for low-information voters at each of the seven political orientations. Thus, this statement accurately cites data from the graph that support Charles and Stephens’s claim about how level of information affects voters.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the only probability in the graph below 50% is for low-information voters categorized as independent (orientation 4), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice C is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the highest probabilities of voting for low-information voters are at the ends of the orientation scale (1 and 7), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice D is incorrect because the graph does not give any information about how many people are represented in any of the categories, so this statement is not based on data from the graph. Furthermore, even if we did have this information, the claim is about how level of information affects voters’ probability of voting, not whether they’re likely to strongly identify with a particular political party.",

    "A": "a haphazard",
    "B": "a contentious",
    "C": "an ineffectual",
    "D": "an arduous",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the creation of The Adventures of Prince Achmed. In this context, \"arduous\" means that the process is marked by great labor or effort. According to the text, the creation of the 1926 animated film The Adventures of Prince Achmed took three years and was a painstaking process.

The graph shows the number of submissions by topic that were made each year. Based on the data in the graph, the student claims that there were more medicine and health research topics submitted in 2019 than in any other year .",
    "Figure": "The graphic is a line chart titled “Total Science Research Submissions” on the first line and “by Topic, 2016–2019” on the second line. The horizontal axis is labeled “Year” and shows four labeled ticks: 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The vertical axis is labeled “Number of submissions,” running from 0 at the bottom to 350 at the top, marked in increments of 50 (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350). Thin black horizontal grid lines span the plot at each 50-unit level, and thin vertical lines align with the year positions, including the y‑axis at the left. Small tick stubs accompany the y-axis labels. The plot area has a baseline at 0 and a top line at 350, both drawn in the same thin black style as the grid.\n\nA legend enclosed in a thin black rectangular box appears below the chart. It lists four topics, each identified by a distinct line style and marker: cellular and molecular biology is a solid black line (stroke width about 2.4) with filled triangular markers at the segment ends; physics and space science is a black dashed line (long dashes, dash pattern about 9–6) with small gray square markers outlined in black at the segment ends (same stroke width as the solid line); medicine and health is a black dot-dash pattern that reads as widely spaced dots (very short dashes with round end caps, thicker stroke, about 3) with small white circular markers outlined in black at the segment ends; animal science is a medium-gray (#999) line, the thickest of the four (about 3.5), with small gray eight-pointed star-like markers outlined in black at the segment ends.\n\nEach series has values plotted at the four years, joined by straight segments using the legend’s styles. Reading from the vertical scale:\n- Cellular and molecular biology: 2016 ≈ 200.0; 2017 ≈ 301.0; 2018 ≈ 280.0; 2019 ≈ 280.0. It rises sharply from 2016 to a peak in 2017 (+101.0), then declines to 2018 (−21.0) and remains flat through 2019 (no change).\n- Physics and space science: 2016 ≈ 97.0; 2017 ≈ 90.0; 2018 ≈ 87.0; 2019 ≈ 100.0. It trends down from 2016 to 2018 (−10.0 overall) and then rises in 2019 (+13.0), ending slightly above its 2016 level by about 3.0.\n- Medicine and health: 2016 ≈ 221.0; 2017 ≈ 220.0; 2018 ≈ 224.0; 2019 ≈ 286.0. It is essentially steady from 2016 to 2018 (within about ±3–4) and then jumps notably in 2019 (+62.0 from 2018), reaching its series high.\n- Animal science: 2016 ≈ 50.0; 2017 ≈ 50.0; 2018 ≈ 50.0; 2019 ≈ 88.0. It is flat at 50.0 for three years, then increases in 2019 by 38.0.\n\nComparisons by year show the relative ordering and gaps. In 2016, medicine and health (≈221.0) is highest, followed by cellular and molecular biology (≈200.0), then physics and space science (≈97.0), and animal science (≈50.0); the top exceeds the bottom by about 171.0. In 2017, cellular and molecular biology (≈301.0) becomes the highest, ahead of medicine and health (≈220.0) by about 81.0; physics (≈90.0) and animal science (≈50.0) trail, for a spread of about 251.0 from top to bottom. In 2018, cellular and molecular biology (≈280.0) remains the highest, with medicine and health (≈224.0) lower by about 56.0; physics (≈87.0) is close to animal science (≈50.0) but still higher by about 37.0. In 2019, medicine and health (≈286.0) is the highest, narrowly above cellular and molecular biology (≈280.0) by about 6.0; physics (≈100.0) is modestly higher than animal science (≈88.0) by about 12.0. Across the span, the two higher series (cellular and molecular biology; medicine and health) cross twice—between 2016 and 2017 (cellular moves above medicine) and between 2018 and 2019 (medicine overtakes cellular)—while the two lower series stay well separated from the higher pair. No shaded regions or reference bands are present beyond the grid lines.",
    "Question Text": "Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to support the underlined claim?",
    "A": "In 2016, the number of cellular and molecular biology topic submissions was the same as the number of animal science topic submissions.",
    "B": "In 2019, there were more physics and space science topic submissions than there were medicine and health topic submissions.",
    "C": "The lowest number of animal science topic submissions in a year was approximately 95 in 2016.",
    "D": "The highest number of medicine and health topic submissions during the period shown is approximately 285 in 2019.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to support the underlined claim that more medicine and health topics were submitted to a national science fair in 2019 than in any of the other years shown. This choice indicates that the approximately 285 medicine and health topics submitted in 2019 are more than the number of medicine and health submissions in any other year shown—a description that is supported by information in the graph, which shows that medicine and health topic submissions were below 250 in 2016, 2017, and 2018, but above 250 (approximately 285 submissions) in 2019.\nChoice A is incorrect because it doesn’t support the underlined claim or accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice refers to 2016 and discusses cellular and molecular biology and animal science, whereas the underlined claim refers to 2019 and discusses medicine and health. Moreover, the claim that in 2016 there were equal numbers of submissions in the cellular and molecular biology category and in the animal science category is contradicted by the graph, which shows approximately 200 submissions and 50 submissions, respectively, for those categories in 2016. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice claims that in 2019 there were more physics and space submissions than there were medicine and health submissions, but the graph shows that there were approximately 100 space and science submissions that year and approximately 285 medicine and health submissions. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately reflect the information in the graph or support the underlined claim about medicine and health research topics. This choice claims that there were approximately 95 submissions for the animal science category in 2016, but the graph shows that the number was closer to 50 in 2016.",

The graphic is a line chart titled “Total Science Research Submissions” on the first line and “by Topic, 2016–2019” on the second line. The horizontal axis is labeled “Year” and shows four labeled ticks: 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The vertical axis is labeled “Number of submissions,” running from 0 at the bottom to 350 at the top, marked in increments of 50 (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350). Thin black horizontal grid lines span the plot at each 50-unit level, and thin vertical lines align with the year positions, including the y‑axis at the left. Small tick stubs accompany the y-axis labels. The plot area has a baseline at 0 and a top line at 350, both drawn in the same thin black style as the grid.\n\nA legend enclosed in a thin black rectangular box appears below the chart.

The graph shows the number of submissions by topic that were made each year. Based on the data in the graph, the student claims that there were more medicine and health research topics submitted in 2019 than in any other year .  The graphic is a line chart titled “Total Science Research Submissions” on the first line and “by Topic, 2016–2019” on the second line. The horizontal axis is labeled “Year” and shows four labeled ticks: 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The vertical axis is labeled “Number of submissions,” running from 0 at the bottom to 350 at the top, marked in increments of 50 (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350). Thin black horizontal grid lines span the plot at each 50-unit level, and thin vertical lines align with the year positions, including the y‑axis at the left. Small tick stubs accompany the y-axis labels. The plot area has a baseline at 0 and a top line at 350, both drawn in the same thin black style as the grid.\n\nA legend enclosed in a thin black rectangular box appears below the chart. It lists four topics, each identified by a distinct line style and marker: cellular and molecular biology is a solid black line (stroke width about 2.4) with filled triangular markers at the segment ends; physics and space science is a black dashed line (long dashes, dash pattern about 9–6) with small gray square markers outlined in black at the segment ends (same stroke width as the solid line); medicine and health is a black dot-dash pattern that reads as widely spaced dots (very short dashes with round end caps, thicker stroke, about 3) with small white circular markers outlined in black at the segment ends; animal science is a medium-gray (#999) line, the thickest of the four (about 3.5), with small gray eight-pointed star-like markers outlined in black at the segment ends.\n\nEach series has values plotted at the four years, joined by straight segments using the legend’s styles. Reading from the vertical scale:\n- Cellular and molecular biology: 2016 ≈ 200.0; 2017 ≈ 301.0; 2018 ≈ 280.0; 2019 ≈ 280.0. It rises sharply from 2016 to a peak in 2017 (+101.0), then declines to 2018 (−21.0) and remains flat through 2019 (no change).\n- Physics and space science: 2016 ≈ 97.0; 2017 ≈ 90.0; 2018 ≈ 87.0; 2019 ≈ 100.0. It trends down from 2016 to 2018 (−10.0 overall) and then rises in 2019 (+13.0), ending slightly above its 2016 level by about 3.0.\n- Medicine and health: 2016 ≈ 221.0; 2017 ≈ 220.0; 2018 ≈ 224.0; 2019 ≈ 286.0. It is essentially steady from 2016 to 2018 (within about ±3–4) and then jumps notably in 2019 (+62.0 from 2018), reaching its series high.\n- Animal science: 2016 ≈ 50.0; 2017 ≈ 50.0; 2018 ≈ 50.0; 2019 ≈ 88.0. It is flat at 50.0 for three years, then increases in 2019 by 38.0.\n\nComparisons by year show the relative ordering and gaps. In 2016, medicine and health (≈221.0) is highest, followed by cellular and molecular biology (≈200.0), then physics and space science (≈97.0), and animal science (≈50.0); the top exceeds the bottom by about 171.0. In 2017, cellular and molecular biology (≈301.0) becomes the highest, ahead of medicine and health (≈220.0) by about 81.0; physics (≈90.0) and animal science (≈50.0) trail, for a spread of about 251.0 from top to bottom. In 2018, cellular and molecular biology (≈280.0) remains the highest, with medicine and health (≈224.0) lower by about 56.0; physics (≈87.0) is close to animal science (≈50.0) but still higher by about 37.0. In 2019, medicine and health (≈286.0) is the highest, narrowly above cellular and molecular biology (≈280.0) by about 6.0; physics (≈100.0) is modestly higher than animal science (≈88.0) by about 12.0. Across the span, the two higher series (cellular and molecular biology; medicine and health) cross twice—between 2016 and 2017 (cellular moves above medicine) and between 2018 and 2019 (medicine overtakes cellular)—while the two lower series stay well separated from the higher pair. No shaded regions or reference bands are present beyond the grid lines. Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to support the underlined claim? In 2016, the number of cellular and molecular biology topic submissions was the same as the number of animal science topic submissions. In 2019, there were more physics and space science topic submissions than there were medicine and health topic submissions. The lowest number of animal science topic submissions in a year was approximately 95 in 2016. The highest number of medicine and health topic submissions during the period shown is approximately 285 in 2019. D Choice D is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to support the underlined claim that more medicine and health topics were submitted to a national science fair in 2019 than in any of the other years shown. This choice indicates that the approximately 285 medicine and health topics submitted in 2019 are more than the number of medicine and health submissions in any other year shown—a description that is supported by information in the graph, which shows that medicine and health topic submissions were below 250 in 2016, 2017, and 2018, but above 250 (approximately 285 submissions) in 2019.\nChoice A is incorrect because it doesn’t support the underlined claim or accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice refers to 2016 and discusses cellular and molecular biology and animal science, whereas the underlined claim refers to 2019 and discusses medicine and health. Moreover, the claim that in 2016 there were equal numbers of submissions in the cellular and molecular biology category and in the animal science category is contradicted by the graph, which shows approximately 200 submissions and 50 submissions, respectively, for those categories in 2016. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice claims that in 2019 there were more physics and space submissions than there were medicine and health submissions, but the graph shows that there were approximately 100 space and science submissions that year and approximately 285 medicine and health submissions. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately reflect the information in the graph or support the underlined claim about medicine and health research topics. This choice claims that there were approximately 95 submissions for the animal science category in 2016, but the graph shows that the number was closer to 50 in 2016.",

In 2019, medicine and health (≈286.0) is the highest, narrowly above cellular and molecular biology (≈280.0) by about 6.0; physics (≈100.0) is modestly higher than animal science (≈88.0) by about 12.0. Across the span, the two higher series (cellular and molecular biology; medicine and health) cross twice—between 2016 and 2017 (cellular moves above medicine) and between 2018 and 2019 (medicine overtakes cellular)—while the two lower series stay well separated from the higher pair. No shaded regions or reference bands are present beyond the grid lines. In 2016, the number of cellular and molecular biology topic submissions was the same as the number of animal science topic submissions. In 2019, there were more physics and space science topic submissions than there were medicine and health topic submissions. The lowest number of animal science topic submissions in a year was approximately 95 in 2016. The highest number of medicine and health topic submissions during the period shown is approximately 285 in 2019. D Choice D is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to support the underlined claim that more medicine and health topics were submitted to a national science fair in 2019 than in any of the other years shown. This choice indicates that the approximately 285 medicine and health topics submitted in 2019 are more than the number of medicine and health submissions in any other year shown—a description that is supported by information in the graph, which shows that medicine and health topic submissions were below 250 in 2016, 2017, and 2018, but above 250 (approximately 285 submissions) in 2019.\nChoice A is incorrect because it doesn’t support the underlined claim or accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice refers to 2016 and discusses cellular and molecular biology and animal science, whereas the underlined claim refers to 2019 and discusses medicine and health. Moreover, the claim that in 2016 there were equal numbers of submissions in the cellular and molecular biology category and in the animal science category is contradicted by the graph, which shows approximately 200 submissions and 50 submissions, respectively, for those categories in 2016. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice claims that in 2019 there were more physics and space submissions than there were medicine and health submissions, but the graph shows that there were approximately 100 space and science submissions that year and approximately 285 medicine and health submissions. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately reflect the information in the graph or support the underlined claim about medicine and health research topics. This choice claims that there were approximately 95 submissions for the animal science category in 2016, but the graph shows that the number was closer to 50 in 2016.",

The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive verb “to study” is correctly used to form a subordinate clause that indicates what Dr. Caballero-Gill uses chemistry and fossil evidence for (to study oceans as they were in the past).\nChoice A is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The finite verb “has studied” can’t be used in this way to form a subordinate clause that indicates what Dr. Caballero-Gill uses the evidence for.

    "Prompt": "“Often Rebuked, Yet Always Back Returning” is an 1846 poem by Emily Brontë. The poem conveys the speaker’s determination to experience the countryside around her: ______ blank",
    "Question Text": "Which quotation from the poem most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    "A": "“Often rebuked, yet always back returning / To those first feelings that were born with me, / And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning / For idle dreams of things which cannot be.”",
    "B": "“I’ll walk, but not in old heroic traces, / And not in paths of high morality, / And not among the half-distinguished faces, / The clouded forms of long-past history.”",
    "C": "“I’ll walk where my own nature would be leading: / It vexes me to choose another guide: / Where the grey flocks in ferny glens are feeding; / Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side.”",
    "D": "“To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region; / Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear; / And visions rising, legion after legion, / Bring the unreal world too strangely near.”",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the quotation that best illustrates the claim that the speaker is determined to experience the countryside around her. In the quotation, the speaker makes it clear that she plans to walk somewhere based on her own wishes (“where my own nature would be leading”) rather than follow anything else (“another guide”), and that she’ll walk “in ferny glens” alongside the mountain.\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation suggests that the speaker wants to avoid pursuing money and education (“busy chase of wealth and learning”) and instead return to some earlier interests (her “first feelings”); the quotation doesn’t address her determination to experience the countryside. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker is describing the circumstances under which she won’t walk, which doesn’t address her determination to experience the countryside. Choice D is incorrect because rather than conveying her determination to experience the countryside, the speaker is explaining a particular thing she won’t do (“seek not the shadowy region”).",

    "Prompt": "In 2022, Crystal Reeck and colleagues studied whether the decision-making modes that guide consumers influence their choice between nonenvironmentally friendly standard electricity plans and environmentally friendly green plans that cap electricity usage. Study participants who self-reported using either an Affect Mode or Role Mode—which prioritize choices that have a stronger positive emotional or social impact, respectively—were more likely to select a green plan. Conversely, participants using a Calculation Mode—which aims to minimize both financial cost and personal inconvenience—were more likely to select a standard plan, even when the green option was cheaper. This finding suggests that participants using a Calculation Mode ______ blank",

    "D": "were less likely to believe that the green plan was truly cost-effective than were participants using either the Affect or Role Modes.",
    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the influence of decision-making modes on consumers’ choices of different electricity plans. The Affect Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker’s social motivations, and the Calculation Mode describes choices based on minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, if those using a Calculation Mode disfavor the green plan, it would be due to some financial or convenience burden the green plan imposes that the other doesn’t. The text indicates that the green plan had a lower financial cost but was nonetheless rejected by participants using the Calculation Mode. It therefore follows that the green plan likely imposed a convenience burden that outweighed potential financial savings for these participants.\nChoice A is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, unlike the Affect or Role Modes, the Calculation Mode would almost certainly involve taking price differences into account. Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, there is no reason to think that participants using the Calculation Mode at any point took social responsibility into account, let alone think that they discovered a disparity between their expectations and reality. Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, the text doesn’t indicate that cost-effectiveness is a factor for participants using the Affect or Role Modes, and there is no basis to compare their beliefs in the truthfulness of the green-plan description with those of the Calculation Mode users.",

According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, the text doesn’t indicate that cost-effectiveness is a factor for participants using the Affect or Role Modes, and there is no basis to compare their beliefs in the truthfulness of the green-plan description with those of the Calculation Mode users.",

C Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the influence of decision-making modes on consumers’ choices of different electricity plans. The Affect Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker’s social motivations, and the Calculation Mode describes choices based on minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, if those using a Calculation Mode disfavor the green plan, it would be due to some financial or convenience burden the green plan imposes that the other doesn’t. The text indicates that the green plan had a lower financial cost but was nonetheless rejected by participants using the Calculation Mode. It therefore follows that the green plan likely imposed a convenience burden that outweighed potential financial savings for these participants.\nChoice A is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, unlike the Affect or Role Modes, the Calculation Mode would almost certainly involve taking price differences into account. Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, there is no reason to think that participants using the Calculation Mode at any point took social responsibility into account, let alone think that they discovered a disparity between their expectations and reality. Choice D is incorrect.

It suggests that CEP attendees held a diverse array of opinions about the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s political philosophy. It establishes that criticism of the CEP was limited to a few individuals in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. A Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text states that the CEP had a positive impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. The next sentence explains that the CEP organized workshops for attendees, who later used the knowledge they gained to lead civil rights initiatives. And the underlined portion indicates the number of activists—more than 7,000—who participated in the workshops. Thus, the underlined portion provides a number that underscores the extent of the CEP’s impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the sentence that contains the underlined portion mentions some CEP workshop topics, the underlined portion itself addresses the number of participants in the CEP workshops, not the number of topics covered. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to attendees of the CEP workshops, nothing in the underlined portion or the text as a whole addresses the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s philosophy or the attendees’ opinions thereof. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole mentions any criticism of the CEP by members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.",

Such movie, such D Choice D is the best answer. The comma appropriately separates the nonessential descriptive aside \"such as…scene\" from the independent clause \"Theaters were…movie.\" Since the descriptive example of roses isn’t necessary for the sentence to function, it needs to be set off with punctuation.\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence. Since the example of roses isn’t necessary for the sentence to function, the descriptive aside \"such as…scene\" needs to be separated from the preceding independent clause with some sort of punctuation. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. A semicolon can only be used to separate two independent clauses, but \"such…scene\" is not an independent clause and couldn’t stand on its own as a sentence. Choice C is incorrect.

    "Prompt": "In the 1970s, a roughly 60,000-year-old piece of hyena bone marked with nine notches was discovered at a site in western France once inhabited by Neanderthals. Although many believe that only modern humans developed systems for notating numbers, one archaeologist asserts that this artifact may be a sign that Neanderthals also recorded numerical information. The notches on the bone are unevenly spaced but approximately parallel, and microscopic analysis reveals that they were made with a single stone tool; according to the archaeologist, this suggests that the notches were all made at one time by one individual as a means of counting something.",
    "Question Text": "Which finding, if true, would most directly weaken the underlined claim?",
    "A": "Parallel lines are a common feature in modern humans’ early systems for recording numerical information.",
    "B": "More than nine approximately parallel notches made with a different stone tool are present on another artifact found at a site in western France.",
    "C": "It would have taken careful effort to make evenly spaced lines on bone with the stone tools typically used by Neanderthals.",
    "D": "Decorative art discovered at another Neanderthal site in western France primarily features patterns of unevenly spaced parallel lines.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The archeologist bases their claim on the fact that the hyena bone features unevenly spaced parallel notches. But if unevenly spaced parallel lines were found on \"decorative art\" at another Neanderthal site, it would suggest that the hyena bone is probably decorative art as well—not a counting tool.\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. If anything, it might actually strengthen the claim: assuming we can make an inference about Neanderthals using a fact about early humans, it provides more support for the idea that the person who made the notches was counting something. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that another artifact had parallel notches made with a different stone tool doesn’t tell us anything about the use of either artifact. For all we know, they could both have been used for counting. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that it took effort to make the lines doesn’t tell us anything about what the lines were for.",
